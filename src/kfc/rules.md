# Rules

## Combat

Each player will roll 10 dice by default, at the start of each fight you can choose one of the following levels of risk and gain bonus dice accordingly. Not all levels will be available for all fights, GM to clarify minimum and maximum acceptable risk. 

* Risk of failure - +2 dice
Failure comes in many forms. Being forced to flee, being captured, getting stuck with the bill, or worst of all, having to admit that you were in the wrong when it was totally the other persons fault.

* Risk of Injury - +4 dice
Injuries are lasting impacts on your character. They may be physical wounds that need time to recover and leave lasting scars. They may become negative traits to your personality, or damage to your reputation or relationships with others.

* Risk of Death - +6 dice.
Make no mistake character death is now on the line.

Once your dice pool is assembled then we play Rivers and Lakes combat rules.

## Out of Combat

There may be times when an action is uncertain outside of a combat encounter. When this occurs the default resolution mechanic will be:
The GM will set a difficulty for the task. 

* 3 – Easy
* 4 – Normal 
* 5 – Hard
* 6 – Impossible

Roll 2D6 and count the number of dice that equal to or exceed the target value. 
If there are 0 successes, then the task is an unmitigated failure. Whatever the situation is, it is about to get a whole lot worse. The GM will narrate the escalation.
If there is 1 success then the task is a partial success. It might not achieve everything you wanted to achieve, or it might have a cost beyond the straightforward cost. The GM will narrate the outcome and may add details to clarify the partial nature of your success.

If there are 2 or more successes then you have fully succeeded and get to narrate the outcome.

### Bonus Dice

There are several ways that you might gain bonus dice for a roll. If you do then simply add any and all applicable bonus dice to your initial two dice that you roll. You still count all success rolls and are after as many successes as possible.

## Qi Points

At the start of each session all characters will receive one Qi point. These points will last until used and may be spent to do any of the following at any time:

1. Gain a bonus dice for an out of combat roll.
2. Adjust any single dice (in or out of combat) after rolling, by a single pip. (4->5 or 4->3)
3. Reroll up to 3 dice from your combat pool at any point during the combat.
