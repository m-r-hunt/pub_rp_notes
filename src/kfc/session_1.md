# Session 1

Started with an excellent interdimensional news report recap.

## Designing the Dojo

We discussed the layout and composition of the Kung Fu Court dojo. We decided there's a chinese restaurant called "Kentucky Famous Chinese" occupying the second former training hall which we no longer use. The phone line now goes straight to them and they'd let us know if it was for us.

## Monkey Business at the Mall

Harlem was watching a movie. Saint and Isamu were waiting for him to finish and drinking bubble tea. Saint did not approve.

A mysterious woman named Felicity/Flick approached them and started asking probing questions. Isamu immediately began to inexpertly hit on her. Harlem appeared from his movie.

At this point, cyber apes crashed through the ceiling.

### Fight Highlights

* Bubble tea to the cyber face by Saint
* Sunlight reflection stun
* Bubble tea straw attack by Isamu
* Bubble tea bubble floor trap
* Harlem deflecting bullets like a Jedi
* Harlem's hand shot before striking Jeffrey by Captain Burton appearing
* Saint thrown into the void after tussling with Burton
* Homing missiles distracted by hot coffee to blast Jeffrey into Ann Summers
* Isamu saved Flick who was being kidnapped by cyber apes
* Jeffery defeated by 1-inch punch, Harlem's signature move apparently

## Dojo Defence

The gang took an unconsious Flick back to the dojo to recover. Definitely not a kidnapping(tm).

Karen phoned up and was hung up on repeatedly. Threating us, after Flick apparently.

Sensei attacked by walking up ominously.

### Fight Highlights

* Sensei continued to walk forward ominously (repeat x 1000)
* Tazed
* Grappling Harlem
* Squashed by a portcullis
* Finally went down to another 1-inch punch, revived by magic aura
* Sensei busted straight into the top bedroom with Isamu and Flick
* Mooks and Karen appeared, somewhat held off by flamethrower gate
* Isamu repeatedly redirected elemental attacks back at Sensei, and then he reflected them back again
* Blanket based attacks
* Saint fired grappling hook up through the floor to help with Hitoshi
* When it looked like we lost, Flick did some bullshit to end the fight.

Flick got out a magic cube and gave it to us.

Flick got out "Useful Bot"/"UB40" - a hovering drone friend and sent him to help us. Instructed us to "find the hideout, sort the elements, fix the vessel".

Then she ran off to distract Sensei et al.

UB40 lead us away from the dojo to a mysterious cave. Which is probably a portal somewhere.


## Final Qi Point Standings

* Ken/Harlem: 1
* Max/Isamu: 1
* Jethro/Saint: 0
