# Session 4

## Facts

* Saint is virgin
* Harlem has a nokia
* Isamu has a weird Japanese flip phone

Recap was a monologue by the kid.

## Infiltration

Stealth takedowns on the 2 guards. Harlem was a distraction. Isamu dropped a fruit on one's head, Saint chloroformed the other.

Grappling hooks up the pagoda. Top floor empty, no element here.

Went down a floor - fancy bedroom. Stole some love letters.

Went down again - big magic pool. Put cube in it, a tidal wave appeared.

> Break time

## Reflection

Confronted by water shadow versions of ourselves in a void.

Isamu flipped for it. Saint had tea and then left politely. Harlem got some cryptic information.

On reentering the real world, there were sounds of pursuit up the tower. Harlem went up to escape and find the kid while Saint and Isamu stayed to fight.

## Fight Highlights

Saint kicked some guards down the stairs and attached a grenade, killing many mooks.

Isamu applied the Kentucky French Caress to some guards coming up the outside.

Harlem fought a priest in the basement with a dagger. Some cool shit with fire and light happened. Priest had weird water powers but Harlem ended up stabbing his heart.

Hopping vampire appeared in the pool room. Piledrivered Saint into the basement.

Isamu followed, stuck him with the cube which messed with him, then deployed the back up gun.

After the fight we burned down the temple, starting the fire with the love letters. (And looted the bodies but not too much there).
