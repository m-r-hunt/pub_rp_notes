## Planning to Blow Up A Ship

Gathered some supplies, including a bunch of bullshit for Isamu. Hit up some food for some cheeky carbo loading.

Went down to the docks to get in a rowboat. Isamu has never navigated an upturned rowboat before (to get close).

### Boat Battle Highlights

Stiff upper lip got plucked.

Red barrels explosion.

Harlem kicked splinter through XO to the captain, all went overboard.

Mook massacring mainly via throws. Donkey kong barelled.

Durian drop and catapult maneuver.

Saint got stuck in the armory.

### Armory Attack

Anti magic gun.

Fake feet riverdancing.

Stand on her and shoot with gun.

Cool guys don't look at explosions but they do run away very quickly.

## Off to Warehouse 3

Stuck the cube in the qi garden.

Saint trippin balls - gardened a bunch

Harlem trippin balls - dug graves for captain and xo

Isamu trippin balls - bullshitted his way past a gargoyle

Powered up the cube.
