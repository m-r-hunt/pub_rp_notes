## Time Shenanigans

We think we're in the past. We set up a silly plan with nested letters to try and figure this out for sure.

We followed UB40 back to the dragon hideout. Faffed around a bit - Saint failed to repair his suit and Isamu grabbed a beer.

Then we went back to the Past Juncture for the first time.

## Past Juncture

Emerged into a smoky room. Went out, it was an opium den. Shit kicked off immediately.

### Fight Highlights

Brazier based combat - slide into shoryuken

Fan monk fought Harlem, Saint did a fan interception.

Owner's bible blocked a Harlem x-ray hit.

"You should take up drinking".

## Tailored to Fit

Did some post battle looting. Came up with fake names:

* Saint George
* Isamaru
* Sandy Harlers

Spoke to a guy Ping Chu. The fight accidentally helped him with the monk. "Go and ask for Mei Ming". Also recommended some tailors.

Also got some money. It appears to be the 1840s-50s. Went to the tailor and got clothes.

Went to the embassy and knocked on the front door to find out about the letter. Bullshitted our way into meeting "The General". Seem to have landed in it.
