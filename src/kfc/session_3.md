# Session 3

Recap was apparently omniscient interdimensional news.

## Fishing for Trouble

We found ourselves in a smoking/drying hut full of fish. Fucked around a bit, could hear people outside.

Went outside, it was a fishing village. They immediately kicked off. We considered surrendering when Saint was negotiating but then just went to fight.

### Fight Highlights

* Bad priest guy tried to breathe poison but Harlem interrupted him
* Isamu fought using a coracle/small boat to counter fisherwoman's boat hook
* Saint needlessly spilled their cooking pot
* Saint burned the fisherwoman in a possibly racist way. "I continue talking"
* Then handcuffed her to a tree
* Harlem's 1-inch punch was blocked
* The boat get set on fire and then used to finish off the priest
* Saint got squid attacked and ninja starfished until taking an injury - now facially scarred

## Meandering Up River

I searched the priest - stole his dagger and lotus pills (possibly for poison breath).

We interrogated some villagers. Found out the temple is about 4 miles upstream.

Hired a kid to take us upriver, along with a man in a boat. (Also it turns out going through the netherworld gave us babel fish powers)

Arrived at the temple. We spent too long on a needlessly convoluted plan to distract temple guards using the kid as bait. Fisherman got killed in a totally preventable way.

Cut right before the fight kicked off.
