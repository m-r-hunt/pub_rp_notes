# Session 2

Another recap, this time Captain Burton's diary.

## A Flawless Break-In

We found ourselves in a cave. Did some shenanigans to create light.

Followed UB40 to a big door, engraved with a (dragon) face-like symbol. It had a keypad lock. Tried a random number, didn't work, an AI came to sass us. Eventually Saint hotwired the door open.

Went in and found a bar/lounge staffroom. Empty of people.

I followed UB40 into a workshop where he went to charge. Got maced by a folder marked "secret plans". Duct taped a gun to my back for future usage.

There was totally normal wifi available with password on a corkboard. Wandered through some bunk rooms, not much in there.

Found a projector room. Turned it on, a Jackie Chan movie was playing. Turned on some computers, one was the AI system. He was unhelpful. We renamed him to Kold Feelingless Computer.

Eventually we discovered the plot inside a whiskey bottle. Two papers: one had a list of elements

* Water - Ancient Juncture - Golden Temple of the Lotus - `<coordinates>`
* Air - Contemporary Juncture - London Observatory - `<coordinates>`
* Fire - Future Juncture - Mt. Etna - `<coordinates>`
* Earth - Past Juncture - Kowloon Docks -  - `<coordinates>`

Other paper had some kind of magic circle-ish diagram with "vessel cube goes here" in the middle.

UB40 confused us after we asked him to take us to the ancient juncture. Eventually we plugged him into the PC and he was able to answer more directly.

Told us that the vessel cube holds elements. Needed clarification on which entrance in junctures to go to.

## Going Potty

We followed him out to the ancient juncture. On the way we encountered 2 terracotta warriors.

### Fight Highlights

* Ineffective nut cracker
* Broke the ear off one and chucked at the other
* Harlem blocked a big sword hit with his hand, flipped it over with judo throws
* 1-inch punched it in the chest
* Saint saved the rest of us with strength and a bulletproof umbrella
* Umbrella up the jacksie and then shattered from the inside
* Sonic cufflink toll the dead attack

## Final Qi Point Standings
