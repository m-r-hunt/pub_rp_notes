## Mech Mercs Make Massive Impact
*By Chert Burtley of the Royal Danides Gazette*

Early yesterday a dropship owned by the mercenary company "The Mechanized Hussars" was spotted landing at Danides Intersystem Spaceport in the planet's capital. This company was identified as those hired by King Edrasivir to "stamp out the minor raids plagueing the system" because although the Royal Guard would "easily smash them" they were "too busy as court to be spared". When asked by a reporter from the disreputable rag "The Davide Times" about the claims made by the so-called "Queen", the King simply spat and had the disrespectful reporter flogged. Quite right too, in this reporter's opinion.

The 3 mech company was met by stunning Princess Leona in her magnificent Blackjack. Princess Leona wore a particularly dashing royal guard uniform that really showed off her eyes, as I'm sure male readers will appreciate. They then paraded down the main city highway to reach the palace, performing an impromptu acrobatics display to the delight of the gathered crowd.

Pausing only to admire the mothballed giant mech in front of the palace, the company pilots entered for an audience with the king. Confidential sources inside the palace told this reporter that the King gave a rousing briefing, really inspiring the pilots as to the import of their task. Afterwards they were seen in contract negotiations with Vizier WIlikins, the king's right hand man.

They hardly had time to finish up before reports came in of a raid on a small mining installation near the capital. The bold mercenaries leapt into action, making great time back to their dropship and flying off to stop the raid.

A short but intense mech fracas followed, as the brave pilots gave the raiders whatfor in a show of boldness and derring-do. After disabling the raider's transport ship by the brilliant maneouver of standing on it, and destroying one of the enemy mechs, the fight was ended by the last enemy mech surrendering to the custody of our King's mighty forces.

Keep your eyes peeled for the next issue of the Royal Danides Gazette where we hope to bring you more updates on the fight against the Queen's raiders.
