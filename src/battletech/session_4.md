## Hussars Held Hostage
*By Bertrand Chertleson of the Danides Times*

Events surrounding the conclusion of the battle over the Lunar Archaeological Site, which previously remained unclear, how now come to light. Thanks to a confidential source the Danides Times has exclusive information about the dramatic events that transpired.

As you may remember from our coverage, one member of the Galvanic Hussars was forced to eject before the end of the battle, a classic show of incompetence. This pilot, apparently known only as Donovan, found himself in an altercation with on of the pilots from the Queen's raiders, one Engeldeo de Roet, a down-on-his-luck nobleman from a minor Danidean house.

Apparently the confrontation ended non-violently, with this Donovan proceeding to attempting to smuggle de Roet on board the Hussars' dropship, after the conclusion of the battle and excavation of the disabled Hussar mech. His ruse was quickly uncovered, and there was a brief exchange of gunfire on board the ship. De Roet was seriously wounded, but due to first aid apparently provided by another member of the Hussars crew he was saved from death. This kind of absolute farce apparently is standard operating procedure for the Hussars.

After stabilizing him, the Hussars proceeded to interrogate de Roet before arranging for his transfer to custody of the Royal Danidean Guard who sent him directly to surgery for his gunshot wound. One source suggests that De Roet had even managed to smuggle an item of archeotech out of the Lunar Digsite which the Hussars confiscated, although the exact nature of this item is unknown. When approached for comment, they claimed De Roet was recovering and being held awaiting trial for high treason as well as interrogation for any information about the Queen's raiders he might have.

Finally, the Hussars proceeded for another session of backroom dealings with Vizier Wilikins behind closed doors. Rumor suggests they may be carrying out security inspections on local mining installations, no doubt with little benefit and great cost to the Danidean people.
