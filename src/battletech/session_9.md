## Heroic Hussars Have Held-out
*By Chert Burtley of the Royal Danides Gazette*

A crushing blow has been dealt by the Ionic Hussars to the Queen's raiders. We have reports that the Queen herself was struck down by a brilliant tactical maneuver from one of the Hussars pilots. They really blew her away.

After cutting off the head of the snake, the Hussars swiftly dealt with any remaining resistance. The traitor Trent Malcolm was unfortunately killed in the chaos, missing out on a trial and a life in jail. On a similar unfortunate note, the captured criminal Engeldeo de Roet apparently also escaped from the palace detention area during the chaos, whereabouts currently unknown.

The Hussars received their well-deserved reward from the King, and apparently are awaiting the next intersystem transport before they head off into the galaxy for further adventures. The people of Danides wish them well.
