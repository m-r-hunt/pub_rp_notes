## The Danidean Hussars - A History
*Bertid Chertoux*

Following the events of the battle of Aquillae Valley, the Hussars rushed back to the capital. They found the city in chaos, with the Queen's Raiders assualting the palace. This proved to be the climax of their campaign. The raiders had, with help from traitors inside the royal guard, infiltrated the palace complex and were in the process of comandeering the so-called "Big Mech", the mothballed prototype that served as a symbol of Danidean Royal authority.

After they set down, the traitor within the Hussars revealed himself. Trent Malcolm sabotaged the Hussars dropship and left in his repaired scout mech. According to statements given later, the Hussars had not been aware of the extent to which the mech had been repaired and made operational by Malcolm, whilst he had been working aboard ship.

Queen Edrolla succesfully powered up the Big Mech using key information which Malcolm had stolen whilst aboard the Hussars dropship. Reunited with her spy, the Queen planned to escape aboard a modified cargo ship with her strike force. Unfortunately for her, the Hussars were still operating at strength and planned to stop her.

After an exchange of fire and a smokescreen had been deployed, the Queen was heading for her transport. In an unexpected move, Boris Baklava launched his mech "Pingu", and managed an astonishing maneuver. He actually landed atop the Big Mech, exploiting the significant size disparity. Then, unbenownst to the Queen's forces, he abandoned his mech and landed atop the Big Mech on foot. The Queen's forces assumed their fire had succesfully crippled Pingu which fell to the ground unpiloted.

Boris Baklava then proceeded to infiltrate the Big Mech, catching the Queen unawares at the controls...
