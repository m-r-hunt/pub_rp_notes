## Royal Mercs Proving Ineffective
*By Bertrand Chertleson of the Danides Times*

The mercenaries hired by the King to supplement the weak and ineffective royal guard, at great expense to the Danides taxpayer, have proven to be just as ineffective themselves. After the so-called "victory" against the Queen's raiders, the prisoner they captured has apparently disappeared from the public eye and not ended up in the royal dungeons facing due process and the rule of law. Instead rumors are flying that he has been recruited as a new senior member of the mercenary company.

Sources inside the palace suggest that the mercenaries finally signed an official contract with the monarchy, taking a gouging cut out of the royal treasury in the process. Meanwhile the DHS suffers from cut after cut and homelessness and unemployment continue to grow.

Even more shocking than that, the mercenaries have been spotted having a clandestine meeting over drinks (no doubt expensed to the Danides govenment) with Aloysius Cawl Jr, noted corrupt interstellar mining executive. Shipments of weapons in Interstellar Mining Co crates were later seen delivered to the Hussar's carrier. When approached for comment, IMC claimed that this was a "misdelivery" that would be resolved in due course. However, no attempt has so far been made to recover the goods.

Speculation as to the mercenaries next moves suggests they may deploy to defend the lunar research outpost unjustly imposed on Danides by the Lyran Commonwealth, more evidence that the weak monarchy must lick the boots of larger states to maintain a tenuous grip on sovereignty.
