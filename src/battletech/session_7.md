## The Danidean Hussars - A History
*Bertid Chertoux*

Although largely overshadowed by the events that were to come, the Hussars raid on the rebel staging area in the Aquillae Valley, named after the Aquillae Dam which exposed it, proved to have a significant impact on the war as well as on the local topography.

Although difficult to verify, legend has it that the Hussars were collectively hung over from a particularly intense Tsartovian party they had engaged in onboard ship the night before. Boris Baklava in particular was said to have spent the previous 16 hours on the toilet recovering from the festivities, donned his mech suit and hopped into the cockpit with nary a shower.

Acting on intelligence that the base would be understrength due to a planned raid which would later prove to be out of date, the Hussars struck at the complex. Managing to reach the valley walls without being spotted, they had the drop on a defenceless skeleton crew. Although there was some initial resistance and defence turret fire, the Hussars detonated an explosive device on the midpoint of the dam, severely damaging it and causing an onrush of water. This mostly wiped out the opposing force.

The morality of this action has been debated by historians, philosophers, and hyrdological engineers to this day. Given the events that followed, the rapid conclusion of this skirmish proved to be a huge boon as the Hussars remained at almost full fighting strength. However, there was significant loss of life and disruption to the local biosphere.
