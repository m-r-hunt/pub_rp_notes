## Breaking News Update: Popular Pilots Punch Pretender's Plunderers
*By Chert Burtley of the Royal Danides Gazette*

The Airbourne Hussars struck another blow against the pretender queen's raiding forces once again today. Defending the Lunar Archeological Site against an attempt to sow havok and sour relations with the Lyran Commonwealth, they struck down a raiding force with prompt action.

Reports say that, after meeting with Professor Knut Ossler who heads the digging team, the Hussars executed a clever ruse involving hiding their mechs around the ruined city. When the raiders struck under cover of a lunar sandstorm, they struck out from their hiding places with a flawlessly executed attack.

During the fighting, one of the hussar's mechs was apparently struck down and rendered temporarily inoperable but should be recoverable.

We're still waiting for a final report on the conclusion of the battle and the fate of the enemy combatants and the hussar who was forced to eject. Stay tuned for more when it becomes available.
