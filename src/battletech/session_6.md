Only much later was it discovered that HRs hard drive had been swapped for a fake. Indeed, it would have been missed completely had HR not requested IT recover some unbanked up files on his hard drive after it’s apparent “crash”. Given later events in the system, it’s reasonably safe to conclude it was stolen by the hussars and the information contained therein was passed to IPD.

Recommendation: tighten security protocols on Danides office. Suppress reports of incident and do not press charges to minimise further negative PR
