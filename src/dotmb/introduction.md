# Introduction

Here are my campaign notes for the Dungeon of the Mad Bear campaign. I only started taking notes somewhat late into the campaign at "Session X", and then only properly regularly at "Session X+2". Anyway check the "Dungeon of the Mad Bear" navigation section at the left for all the sessions I have taken notes for.
