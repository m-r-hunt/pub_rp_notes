Recap.

## Asteroids and Airborne Lizards

Decided to wait near the big eye inside a tiny hut. Nothing happened.

Went to the next room, it seems to be a viewing gallery. Ivy noticed a secret trapdoor in the ceiling. Popped open the door and encountered some Githyanki. We surrendered to them - Earnest got tied up and we had a bit of a standoff. The Githyanki knight went to get help. Came back with someone who could communicate.

Eventually they tried to levitate us upwards so we kicked off.

We had a big fight involving some badly done multilevel rooms.

Looted the bodies, one of the gith had a bunch of gems in their armour. The knight had a cool silver greatsword. One of the Gish had a rod of some kind.

Took a short rest in a tiny hut. Ivy got some heat exhaustion. Earnest discovered that the rod was sweet smoky and spicy.

Opened some doors that seem to be prison cells. Found a Githzerai. Asked him WTF is going on. Ezira.

The Crystal Labyrinth is a Githyanki outpost in DotMM. Linked to here. Red dragons and Githyanki are allies, Githyanki knights use young red dragons as mounts.
