# Session X+16

_Date: 03/12/23_

Attendance: Everyone

Went down to the next fire giant. After nosing around a bit, knocked on a door. A big fire giant lad came out to talk to us. Chatted to him for a bit, gave him some scorpion metal and he let us in. His name was Druvax.

Went in, saw some fire giants and goblins sorting metal. Also some weird statues. Chatted to Druvax some more, confirmed that Arcturia isn't here. They have a secret project, they won't show us anything. They will give us directions. Earnest tried to trick Druvax with an arm wrestle but he wasn't having any of it.

Headed in following giant directions. Walked past a room with hobgoblins training. Walked past a treasure room and decided not to do casual burglary. Found a weird eye pillar that's probably a beholder thing. Went in and found the stairs down, floor speedrun complete.

Went down. Ezra told us this floor is wild, death tyrant, gameshow, all kinds of shit.

For reasons unrelated to Matt not being prepared, we went back for a bit. Went back to a door with a weird stone on it. Detected magic, lots of abjurations, couldn't dispel it. Eventually we took it off and smashed it, for some reason. The stone screamed at us and someone came out of the room. It was a cool tiger man. He was trapped, wanted to bugger off out of the dungeon.

He gave us a key and said there were 6 more to power a wrath effect for this floor. Also we could steal Arcturia's spellbook, hidden north behind a secret door. Also in some nested secret doors is Arcturia's phylactery.

Rakshasa's name is Alussiarr.

Doom means lord's domain and is associated with liches.

Let Alussiarr go and went off to find the secret rooms. Alussiarr had a chill room to nap in. Went north and found the advertised secret passage. Found a bunch of spellbooks. "Most of the wizard spells". 

Arcturiaâ€™s Arcane Esoterica: Vol. IX, and it contains the following spells: 
* antimagic field
* astral projection
* dominate monster
* feeblemind
* gate
* incendiary cloud
* power word kill
* power word stun
* shapechange
* telepathy
* true polymorph
*  wish

Found another nested secret room. It had Arcturia's phylactery (which was somehow not magical).

Prayed for divine intervention to destroy the phylactery. It worked, and manifested into a mimic which ate the phylactery, which is apparently what you need to destroy the phylactery.

Eventually we decided to take the baby with us down to the obstacle course.
