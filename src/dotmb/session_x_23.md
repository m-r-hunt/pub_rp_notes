# Session X+23

_Date: 16/02/24_

Attendance: Everyone

Continued a big fight. Killed death tyrant after he healed once. Zarrus died and got zombified, resurrected him after.

Didn't seem to be any treasure.

Chatted with Ezra.

Went with Ezra to his crib. Met up with some more githers (Yrlakka Azal and Vond Rishindar). They gave us a fire potion and a detect magic wand. 

They are just monks hanging out planning the destruction of the mind flayers. Also they have a gate direct to mind flayers. Told them about mind flayer shit and they seemed ready to transform and roll out.
