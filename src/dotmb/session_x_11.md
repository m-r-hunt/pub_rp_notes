# Session X+11

_Date: 24/9/23_

Attendance: Not Caspar

Went back to talk to the Hobgobbos to tell them we won. A booming voice sounded and told the hobgobs to piss off. Chatted for a bit, they gave us directions to get around through some wormfree tunnels.

Went back north, Zox was there hanging around the arch with his big metal bear. Talked to Zox, somewhat offering to help him. He wants a control device from one of Torbrand's contraptions in the floor. Workshop or dug.

The arch is the "simulacrux". Will revolutionize the nature of the security throughout the dungeon. It will copy and paste his robot scorpions. Zox has delusions of grandeur.

According to Zox there are "smilies" - "creepy clown children who live in the metal". - Lava children are things we've heard of apparently.

Went over near Zox, all the spellcasters can feel magic near the big gate.

Decided to go to Torbrand's workshop. Went east and found a cavern with some rust monsters and metal bees. Ignored them, went north to find Torbrand's workshop.

Torbrand's workshop had a bunch of junk. Also a big war platform thing (shocker stomper). We fought the big war platform thing. It was kinda tough but we got there by making it into a big bottle.
