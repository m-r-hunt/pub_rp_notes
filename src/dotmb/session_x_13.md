# Session X+13

_Date: 10/11/23_

Attendance: Everyone

Wandered through the tunnels. Came to the back of Zox's fortress with some dead rust monsters around. Walked around the perimeter.

Found some Azer (fire dwarfish). They were making children. Or possibly tools for Zox. Ivy became one of them and blatantly lied to them about Zox being done. Got some infodump from them, made plans to bust in ("crack this fortress like a nut").

Theo to go on the roof and smash it with an admantite pickaxe. He did it (after hearing some gnome techno and picking a different spot). From the inside he saw a glyph of warding on the door. Got everyone in through the ceiling. The techno was coming from a shitty music box.

Explored the fortress a bit, didn't find much. Entered a room and found a badger and an arch gate. Made friends with the badger. Looked at the safe, it had a weird badger-based puzzle. We cast knock on it instead. It had a shit load of gold in it. Grabbed the stuff and took the arch gate to the lost level.

Debated what to do, probably long resting and killing a worm.

One of the things we got was the Ingot of the Vind Rune, a cool special magic metal ingot.

Zox's notes had info about building robot animals.

Long rested in the divination room.
