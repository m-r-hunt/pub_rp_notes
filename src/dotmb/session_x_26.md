# Session X+26

Attendance: Everyone

Wandered around some empty hallways.

Found a room with a statue and a what appeared to be a person but was just a robe.

Next room: someone fucked shit up. Went in, and the shadow dragon appeared. Sam picked up a piece of tapestry and had a vision. We reassembled the tapestry which matched that.

Went down a corridor, a magic mouth gave us a vague warning.

Found a chamber with 2 big statues holding a curtain of shadow up. It's got bad juju. We messed with it a bit but didn't go through.

Found a room with hooks on the walls and a cool horn. The horn gave me a vision.

Found a cavern that was the stairs up.

Found the gate room, finally, next to where we started. Summoned some lil guys to cast silence on it to open it up. Headed to the surface.
