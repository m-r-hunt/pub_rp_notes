# Session X+2

_Date: 2/6/23_

Recap.

## Lore Dump

Cast legend lore on the gem (i.e. not the slaad).

Gem of lord of foetid obliteration. Slaad used throughout DotMM as servants. Rumored MM can manufacture slaads, possibly using a "spawning stone" which attracs slaad and creates control gems. Death slaads most dangerous. Cunning tricksters, good at transforming and infiltrating, allow Halaster to control people.

This gem's slaad is lord of foetid obliteration. "Most trusted but no slaad can be trusted". Gem controls mind and not heart of slaad. Lord is resentful of servitude. Most recently posting is figurehead of black tongue tribe, leading them into foetid stagnant fuedalism. (Black tongues are frog clan.)

We changed the slaad's orders to continue its previous instructions.
A lot of debate about what to do with the slaad.
We told it that it's not under hallaster's control and to get in touch via "froggy messengers" if necessary. And to tell us his previous instructions, hopes and dreams.

## Back to Dungeon Wandering

We found the shower.

We found a student's room. Found a non-poisoned banana which Zarrus ate. Turns out it was Skrianna's room. We decided to loot her chest. 

* Broken Mirror
* 10x fine clothes
* Wand
* Poisoner's kit
* Vial of Fine Perfume - 75gp
* Diary - lover named Akkamar. References to family members Zalthar and Dezmyr, from shadowdusk hold, plan to return in force with construct halaster's building in Arcturiadoom.

Went to another student room. Glyph of warding set off a thunder trap and fucked us up. It was Spite's room. Found a tiny jewelled chest. Of course we tried to open the chest. Gave off a conjuration magic signature. Theo checked for traps and it seemed fine. It was empty.

Found a vacant room. Definitely a normal empty room.

Went into another room. 16 cloudy jars containing preserved human brains. Find 9 other unbrained jars. Find a weird metal book with embossed pages. I drank the Potion of Comprehension to read it. Turns out it's a spell book written in Qualith (mindflayer-ese).

* Mind Blank
* Dominate Monster
* Globe of Invulnerability
* Wall of Force
* Modify Memory
* Confusion
* Lightning Bolt
* Non-Detection
* Invisibilty
* Detect Thoughts

Went into another room. Found Elan, who's dead. Stabbed by his own sword. He had a portable lolth shrine. It makes people go mad but I resisted, it was fine. We burnt his body. A small spider scuttled away.

Opened the last room. There was an ogre zombie inside with a book inside its ribs. Killed the ogre very quickly. The book was another spellbook. Covers carved from coffinwood and pages made of stitched skin, written in blood.

* Animate Dead
* Blight
* Contact Other Plan

We chucked it into our existing fire. It screamed on the way out. The wardrobe was full of red robes - it was Nihlus's room.

Found the coat room. Found the waiting room. Full of rubbish armchairs. Found the bathroom.

Went down to reading nook. Ran into Cephalosk (mind flayer lad). Told us the Elder Brain has put out a Ultharid to (eventually) found a splinter colony. Cephalosk hates this and wants us to kill him. Ultharid is obsessed with Waterdeep. Big mass of minds fascinates him. Is trying to create "Alterdeep" which is a "simulation" or "grand illusion" copy of the minds of Waterdeep. Just like Roblox. Elder Brain is focused on survival because of the precarious placement of the hive. Extremiton is the name of the Ultharid. He would give us more info if we give him Spite's brain.

Went into the "portrait room". Has a big, possibly threatening, picture of the mad mage behind a curtain. We set fire to it.

Found a fountain room. Big mad mage fountain guarded by 2 Mezaloths. Not much going on.

Found another corridor with some bedrooms, connected to the one bedroom Air Elemental!Ivy had been to before.

Opened one of the doors and a wall of ice appeared. Ivy melted a hole and went in. Violence was there. We told her about the headmaster and she went off to find her sister and peace out. Her room has a little gloryhole over to Turbulence's neighbouring room.

Turbulence's room was boring, she's a fuckin nerdo.

Final student room: appeared to be looted. Had a signed Jim Darkmagic painting left over.

We found the garbage pit.

Found another painting room. 15 paintings behind a curtain. Each depicts a graduating class. Almost all show skeleton students. I spotted Castus who is skeletonised. Halaster is missing from the central portrait in the middle row. Theo tried to take that picture. He got an Elder Rune, the Rune of Halaster which exploded him a bit.

We found an alchemy room. Armitox told us the cauldron had living poison weirds in it so we didn't fuck with it. There were many alchemy ingredients and we stocked up on some misc things we needed.

We found a classroom. On one of the chalkboards. "Wizards of Yore class canceled. Research Ahghairon circa 1071 DR. Expect a quiz!" Ivy wrote "The Dean is no more, Leave this floor" instead.

Found a room with some braziers and spectators (i.e. shitty beholders). Apparently guarding some wizard supplies. Found a secret passage which lead to another room. Medley was there. We had a brief chat. She transformed into a Night Hag. A bunch of undead popped up and attacked us.

I turned undead and it actually worked. Caspar was enfeebled. Night Hag started to run away and put me to sleep. We killed her. The flesh golems wigged out. I got knocked out. We mopped up the flesh golems eventually.

We found a frog in a box in a barrel. It spat out a Gem of Seeing when we freed it.

We went to search Wormriddles room now she's dead. Found some Night Hag toenails, sweet loot. Some of her creepy dolls have moved around. They are voodoo dolls of all the students. We took the Spite andd Skriana ones and dispelled the rest.
