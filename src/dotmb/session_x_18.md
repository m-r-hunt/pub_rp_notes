# Session X+18

_Date: 29/12/23_

Attendance: Everyone

Hanging out in the portal room. Everything started leaking black ink and then we got zapped by beholder beams. The dwarf got disintegrated, rest of us got fucked up in some way.

Faffed around healing and resummoning.

Hit the gong, some bread and water appeared. Caspar drank some water and did not obviously die.

Went out and tried to open a door for a bit.

Backtracked, looked at the pit with a coffin in. "A coffin is like a tiny death room". Has dwarven rune of death on it. Ended up flying over the pit.

Came across a suspicious sign saying loot to SW in dwarvish.

Went NE and opened a door. Found a brazier and a statue and a pit. Statue's jaws are hinged and locked, tiny keyhole between eyes. Picked lock and statue's mouth opens, dropping a ladder into pit. Caspar climbed down. The pit has an antimagic field.

Messed about with flames in various ways. Jethro checked an alcove and got teleported away. The rope caused us to get split up - only me and the dwarf were left behind.

Sam and Sophie encountered some lava mephits and magma children in some lava.

Jethro and Caspar got teleported back to a violent statue. Quickly reunited with us. Found our way over to the lava chasm that's connected to where S&S are.

Sam looked at some vaults, with weird triangle holes in the walls. Walked out onto the balcony and spotted us across the lava chasm. Tried to fly over but got knocked out of the air.

Lava hurts.

Seems like there's some kind of field that pulls things down over the lava.

Lava children creepy as per us(ual). They climbed back out to the balcony.

Faffed around trying to figure out how to get across (mainly the pegasus). Ended up climbing across. I fell in the lava but misty stepped to safety. Also saw an archgate really far away.
