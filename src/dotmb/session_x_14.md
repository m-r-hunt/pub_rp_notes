Went to see the Slaad. Texted him that we were there.

Some armed bullywogs appeared. They were after us. Their emperor has been pissed off since we got the slaad gem (it's him).

Followed them towards the bullywog place. Passed by various bullywogs riding various invertebrates. Saw the king we spoke to before.

Emperor is named Yurk Yâ€™blorkflug. Took us in to see him. He's a big ass lazy bullywog.

Asked him some questions. He wants freedom. If free, he'll work for the slaad lords, who are his gods probably. He's made about being enslaved, kind of contemptuous of the bullywogs. If freed, he would return to limbo. And then when finished dancing, return to the negative energy plane.

Offered to free him if he swears to go away. He said he would.

We compelled him to tell us if he was lying. He was not but told some half truths. Then he was pissed. He levitated up and summoned some hydras.

Earnest charmed the hydras.

Eventually we freed him. He was pleased, but still a lil bitch.

We left, Earnest tried to ride the hydra out. Or lead it out. Didn't go great.

Flew up and found a secret stash. There was a bunch of money and a belt of giant strength.

Left, tried to get away with it. Totally got away with it.

Then left to go back to what we were doing before. Went through a new gate, Theo got the elder rune of passage, and got paralyzed.

Got back to the hob gobbos, he asked us about Zox's fortress. Tried to get them to help us with the worm. We paid. They also brought hellhounds.

Set up the wall of force trap. Worm ran into it. Kicked off. Hobgobbos fired the cannons which turned out to be big gravity lasers.

Paused mid combat.
