# Session X+11

_Date: 03/11/23_

Attendance: Not Caspar

Popped open the shocky boy. Found a control module. Also a glass sphere full of lightning.

Went back along the floor, detected some magic in the rust monster/wasp room. Fought them, that was easy. Found an alarm clock and an exploding d12.

Circled back to take a look at Zox's worktress. Found some tunnels and took a look. Encountered creepy lava children. Left them to it mostly.

Found our way out of the tunnels, ran into some scorpion guards. Had a fight.
