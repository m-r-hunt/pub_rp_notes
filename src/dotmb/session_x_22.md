# Session X+22

_Date: 02/02/24_

Attendance: Everyone

Level up and recap stuff.

Divination told us Ezria is behind the skull doors and in danger.

Initiated a fight with the lurking crossbow boys. When stepped out they shot us. Also the commentator told us we have a 1 hour time limit. Killed one of them, the other ran away.

Unseen servant was resetting the wheel behind us.

Went off to try and find Ezria, leaving the dragon statue behind.

Found an antichamber with a statue of hallister holding coins. Also some humming porculli. Continued north.

Went back to the start. Jumped over a speculative pit trap. Voice heckled us. There was an iron golem. Shot at it from the other side of a pit trap. It jumped over the pit. 

Killed the golem. Its eyes were 2 very expensive black sapphires.

Thought about leaving Thwad behind for this fight but took him anyway.

Went into the room. Big carved beholder hanging over Ezria who's chained to the floor. Netherskull is here (death tyrant). Big pillars made of souls. Netherskull had some generically evil dialogue. It feels bad in here with netherskull looking at us.

I tried to figure out what the deal was with the negative energy in here. Failed utterly.

He seemed to be shielded. We tried hitting a pillar which seemed to do something. Netherskull fired off some rays on his turn including summoning a beholder zombie.

Smashed a pillar. His shield seemed to get weaker.
