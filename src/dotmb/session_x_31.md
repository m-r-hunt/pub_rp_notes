# Session X+31

_Date: 14/06/24_

Attendance: Everyone

Went through a door - four more doors

Tried a door, extra locked. Cast knock on it, it knocked back.

Had a bit of a fight with some mind flayers.

Opened the door and the room was all lovecrafty. Decided not to go through the portal (for now).

Went south and found a prison.

Had a bit more of a fight.

Freed some people from prison and the matrix. One of them was an intellect devourer and somehow we 360 noscoped it easy every time.
