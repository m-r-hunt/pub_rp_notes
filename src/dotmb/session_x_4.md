Attendance: All

Recap.

## The Dangers of Lichdom

Opened the last door on the floor (maybe). It was labelled "necromancy". Inside was Nestor, a servitor. We decided to listen to his lecture on the dangers of lichdom, for some reason.

You might become an allip if you get obsessed with knowledge. He showed us one.

If you fuck up the soul transfer potion, you might become a necreor (blood monster).

If you make a bad pact to gain power, you might become a wraith.

If you can't get the soul into the phylactery, your soul will wander off and bind itself to something else evil and become a boneclaw.

Nestor got so wrapped up in his studies he forgot to eat souls and became a demi-lich.

Advice on protecting phylacteries: make it unassuming or something adventurers want to keep.

We tried and failed to get the dragon to help us kill Nestor. After a bunch of faff, we decided to kick off.

> Break time

We fought and defeated Nestor and his undead buds.

Long Rest + Level Up

## To The Moon

Went to the moon with the dragon. Theo got a rune, which was good for once. It was all moonish.

The gate we came through crumbled. There were 3 other gates that we old and broken. There was a large runic circle. The runic circle had a slot to change the direction(?) currently set to up. There was an unmoving star above us.

The Adored did know Glister (now shadow dragon). Glister enjoyed being in human form and spent a long time accompanying an evil(?) human. Vanrak Moonstar of doom fame.

We took the portal up.

It was very hot where we ended up. Room filled with red scales. There was a gate here. Pedestal in front.

Tapestry to the north. Engraved floor.

Lava to the south. 6 speckled eggs sitting in the pool.

Massive dragon hoard to the west.

Went to check out the tapestries. They show Tiamat fighting stuff. Engraving of Tiamat on the floor. Seems to be a shrine. Also some doors, could hear children behind 1.

Opened a quiet door. There was a sleeping red dragon and some windows. We are in fact in space, and there's also a big red dragon chilling out in space. Decided to shut the door and try somewhere else.

Opened another door and found some Githyanki hanging out in a mess hall. They were eating some weird stuff.

Checked the treasure horde which was an illusion for some reason. Real pile of treasure to the north and passage to the south.

Went south and opened a door. There was another room. Altar and big statue of a githyanki warrior killing a mind flayer. And also a big ghost eye.
