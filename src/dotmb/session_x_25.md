# Session X+25

_Date: 24/02/24_

Attendance: Everyone

Reze came into being. Some roleplay and healing.

Wandered around the dungeon for a bit. Found a room with some fountains. Seemingly nothing important.

Found an empty room with pillars and some webs.

Found a room with many coffins. Didn't really go in.

Opened another room and found a mad vampire on the ceiling. Named Broke. Baited him out with blood and killed him.

Found some pits. Dead rats at the bottom. One had magical darkness for some reason. Moved on.

Found a room with many bats. Ivy spoke to them. Calmed them down a bit. We went the other way.

Heard some evil god chanting round a corner.

Went another way. Heard squeals of anguish. Found a guy being eaten by cultists. Kicked off, killed them. Turns out he was also a cultist taking a test. Killed him too.

Opened a southern door. Found some vampires eating a guy, killed them. The guy seemed to have voluntarily given himself up.

Opened another door. Found some very wimpy cultists with some greased up loot. (Matt todo)
