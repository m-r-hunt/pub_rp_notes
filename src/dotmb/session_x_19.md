# Session X+19

_Date: 12/01/24_

Attendance: Not Me

First we went north, trying to find the "out of bonds" section where the gith might hang out.

The northern chasm has the stench of undeath. It also has a statue of hallister. And in the distance a "horde of zombies".

We decide to go south.

First we must cross a 10 ft chasm after much debate we settle on the genius move of MOMENTUM JUMPING (tm). Strong people go over first, set up ropes that then work as impromptu harness's for heavy Theo. Lightweight Ivy just piggybacks across.

After jumping 2 chasms we come to a room with 3 pillars. The pillars have closed eyes facing a giant key in the middle of the room. We attack the pillars with the pick to destroy them pre-key grab. The pillars were ropers.

The fight would have been easy but every round the pillars shot a beholder bolt at us. The first one summoned a flameskull that blew itself up. The party gets pretty badly beaten up again.

Immediately after the fight ivy gets Telejumped halfway across the known world. The statue does not attack them.

After the fight we collect the key and everyone short rest except ivy who has a solo adventure back.

We find the lava chasm continues much further than we thought. And gets much bigger and higher and harder to navigate.

There's another group of mephits and lava kids, but unlike the previous ones that were just hanging out having a good time these one's were having some kind of business meeting.

Ivy uses "vine lash" to get across chasm.

There's a strange room that seems to be a Drow religious site.

In the distance there's a translucent knight that we ignore.

We enter the "worst room" with some extremely NSFW depictions on the walls.

Ivy checks in on Fredja but they leave her behind.

During our short rest we are informed of Ivy's exploits by the floor wide narration.

We don't notice anything odd during short rest by narration says "The sand of time are running out".

Ivy returns and the party is reformed!

There is a glittering bridge crossing the massive chasm. After some experimentation we conclude that the bridge is allergic to magic items.

We debate using mage hand to carry all our items across behind us, but the bag of holding is too heavy. In the end we create a "bridge of force" out of wall of force and use it to cross the canyon. This is fortunate as it doesn't cause Earnest to learn his intelligence is coming from his magical circlet.

On the far side of the bridge is a fancy door (tm). It doesn't have a keyhole but it looks like it might be endgame for the gameshow. It also has big pillars of eyes next to it.

After some debate (understatement) we open the door.

It's a wall with an enormous rune: that immediately hits us.

It drives 2/3rds of us mad, and gives Theo and Earnest a future reroll of a damage dice.

What follows is the stupidest possible "fight" in which we mostly just want to stop people who are mad from rolling a 2 and and then a "north" and running towards lava in their confusion.

We navigate the canyon east and arrive at the archgate we glimpsed at the end of last week.

This arch gate is comprised of hundreds of puzzle pieces, no obvious puzzle, just lots of jigsaw pieces assembling the gate. It sits on a floor littered with ancient dwarvish armor.

Ivy removes a piece, and Sophie rolls a D100.

A "puzzle dragon" appears. We roll initiative.
