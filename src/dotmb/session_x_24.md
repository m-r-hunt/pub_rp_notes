# Session X+23

_Date: 24/02/24_

Attendance: Everyone

Discussed what to do for a long time. Ended up going through the gate.

Found a somewhat dingy chandlery. Picked up a black candle.

Went out to a corridor which is a bit badly lit. Went into a distinctly foggy room. Found a Shattered Throne(tm). Had a vision when approaching. It was a depressed guy, Vanrak(?) complaining about shar, it seems we're in Vanrak Doom.

Shar is sister of selune. Goddess of darkness and general gothy stuff.

Approaching the throne, thick smoke formed into a shadow dragon. Who could have seen this coming? It wants us to bugger off, but isn't attacking. Used true seeing to find out it's an illusion.

Examined the throne and find a mithril chainshirt. Some angry shadows then appeared. They murdered me with strength reduction damage. Got reincarnated into a new character.
