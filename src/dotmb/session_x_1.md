# Session X+1

_Date: 26/5/23_

I didn't make notes for this one. Jethro was back and I hadn't commited to always making notes.

TL;DR We went into the death room and fought the dean who was a foxboy (arcanoloth). We killed him and stole his mysterious slaad gem. Also a book of runes which spawned our best friend, Krenko the goblin. Also his spellbook.

Went to headmaster's study, found a bunch of books about history. 20 books x 100gp = 2000gp
