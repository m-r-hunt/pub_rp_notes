# Session X+10

_Date: 10/9/23_

Attendance: Everyone

Recap.

Encountered a worm trench. Dug by a mechanical giant worm named Dug. Armitox is interested in the poison.

Met some hobgoblins. They are looking out for a gnome named Zux, torbrann's apprentice, something about metal scorpions. Their boss is a hobgoblin warlord named Doom Crown. Doom Crown serves the fire giants.

This is Trobrann's Graveyard. The floor above is Arcturiadun.

Worm came past, some of us fell over.

Ended up deciding to help the hobgoblins against Zux. Went north to a big battlefield around an arch. Metal scorpions/Scaladar were around as well as arbalests (flying crossbows).

Helped some hobgoblins snipe at the monsters around the big arch. We beat them all up although all the hobgobs died, including Kellog. Some of us coincidentally found some shiny new +1 half plate.

Zarrus attempted to kill the arch with his warpick but did not have much success.
