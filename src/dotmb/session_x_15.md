# Session X+15

_Date: 25/11/23_

Attendance: Everyone - Jethro

Had a big fight. Killed the worm. Zox popped up with some scorpions to attack us.

After we killed Zox's bear he morphed it and the scorpions into a super scorpion-bear-tank. Beat the scorpion thing by Ivy infiltrating and murdering Zox.

Got some stuff: 

* Hurricane Lance
* Ring of Free Action
* Ring of Scaladar Control

Got some poison from the worm for Armitox. Armitox told us about being involved in creating the worm (doug). Armitox was associated with Torbrand. Made the poison for the worm obvs.

Paid off the surviving hobgoblins. Got them to look after Zox's badger.
