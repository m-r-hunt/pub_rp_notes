Recap.

## Team Trees

Decided to work on executing our tree based teleportation plan. Need to go back to the fridge. Open the door to the map room and got into a fight with some Gith guards. Killed them.

Found some info about the Gith swords. They are specifically designed to sever mind and body. On crit, forces astral projection. Normally reversible but dying at the same time messes you up (e.g. Zarrus). Suggests repair using the spell Tether Essence.

One of the gish was reading about scrying magic/divination. Also took a crystal ball which was not nailed down. It's the magic item "Crystal Ball".

Went back to the airlock room to chill out. Ivy looked at the food in the fridge to find out what to use as a plant teleporter.

While chilling, some red mist entered the room. We dispelled it, and it turned into a dwarf. Ashtyrranthor. We remembered this is actually the adult red dragon who's been around the asteroid. We explained the situation. (Gith commander Commander Zolcharrx, 2nd in command Raajna). He is relatively fine with us as long as we don't hurt red dragon children.

The red dragons were here first on the asteroid. Githyanki came later. They made friends.

Ashtyrranthor told us about a quest to steal a magic item from the Gith commander. A manual of golems. Basically it would be funny to steal it.

The Gith are pissed at us, unsurprisingly.

Ashtyrranthor left us in peace.

We rested and executed our long rest and plant teleport plan. It worked well. We ended up back in waterdeep.

Made some plans for what to do in waterdeep before venturing back into the dungeon.
