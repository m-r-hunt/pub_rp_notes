# Session X

Date: 5/5/23

I took notes for this session as a one off because Jethro was away.

Recap for last session.

Info dump - individual side projects + mind flayer info in multiple parts:

## Mind Flayer Stuff

### Physical Nature

* Increased cranial capacity - big heads, smort
* Share psychic connection in colony, shared intelligence in colony
* Physically average relative to normies
* Keep thralls - 1 mindflayer - >=2 thralls
* Thralls have brain removed or just enslaved by magic
* A bunch of slave races exist - see also Out of the Abyss
* Need to eat brains - sustenance and pleasure  "stick octopus tentacles on someone's head and suck"
* Asexual, reproduce by cermorphosis(?). 1x per life, lay eggs, eggs inserted into humanoids, body horror occurs, host becomes mindflayer
* Apply mind flayer eggs to non-humanoids, get weird monsters
* "Mind Witness" - mind flayer beholder - spooky
* hearing is worse than average

### Social and Historical Structure

* "Culture of fugitives" - haven't been dominant for 1000s of years, used to control everything
* Gith revolted, broke free, overthrew mindflayer empire
* Mindflayer colonies scaterred, secret, worried for survival
* What we do every night pinky, try to take over the world
* Individuals view "lesser" races as food, very dismissive
* Colony controlled by Elder Brain, center of hive mind
* Colonies fairly well aligned and on the same page

### Magic

* View themselves as masters of psionic magic - arcane magic is wild/unpredictable/primitive
* Some mindflayers are born with/learn arcane abilities. 
	* Renegades, dismissed and killed by colony. 
	* Must shield themselves from their hive and cut ties to survive.
	* Leaving colony is effectively giving up eternal life through the hivemind
	* Often leavers want to become liches. "Alhoon" is halfway step to being fully liched
* They all use psionics.
* "Mind Blast" stuns people with minds. Can hit group

### Elder Brains

* "Ultimate expression of illithid domination"
* Big brain in a jar - does have tentacles but basically immobile
* Dominate and control people
* Can sense creatures - aware of every creature within 5 miles that has int of at least 4. Knows distance and direction and rough int score. "Blips on a radar"
* Fed other mindflayer tadpoles
* Do age and weaken - eventually an ulitharid is born to replace old elder brain
* Hard to move
* Colonies designed to hide elder brain - not in center but hidden away, no thralls know etc

### Famous Mindflayers
> While searching for information on Mind Flayers, you find a list of notable illithids: Nihiloor, Grazilaxx, Xetzirbor. One in particular strikes you though: Captain N'ghathrod of the large squid shipâ€“type spelljammer _Scavenger_

# Individual Questions

## Binding of Immortal Souls

(See also research notes on roll20)

Naga souls always reform after n days. To kill permanently, bind soul to mortal coil. Cast ressurection-like spell, then defeat naga in combat. Turns them into bone naga. Kill bone naga, gone forever. We have knowledge to cast modified ressurection from this.

For Murial, nothing specific. Seems like Murial is reverse Naga. Body indestructible but soul could be weak. Unknown how to do this.

## Sentient Staffs and Such

If a powerful wizard keeps a staff, part of soul can become bound to staff. When they die, can live on in staff. But it sucks real bad. Worst way to be immortal.

Rantantar is/was chaotic illusionist. Weapon of choice was wand of wonder (powerful and chaotic, see handout on roll 20 for full detail). Rantantar turned against hallaster and worked with Jhesirya to modify nature of magic. Hallastar obliterated Rantantar but wand contains part of him. Rantantar is anti-hallaster, could be ally to us?

Armitox voluntarily became a staff. This is unusual. "Avid researcher and complained about weakness of flesh". Had a lover (details missing) who bore staff.

# Library Scene

Zarrus got lost in library. Spots Darcy. Darcy returned him to the party. Zarrus got 20h madness, disadvantage on rolls more than 30 feet from Darcy.

# Upgrading Armitox

Turns out we had one of the 4 poisons the whole time from Murial. We argued a bit about whether this was a good idea and what the motivation is.

Armitox ate the poison, had a good time. Armitox is trying to destory an artifact that stole her boyfriend - Mighty Servant of Leuk-o

# Resuming Exploration

We decided to continue blimbling around the current floor. Killing the Naga to free their slaves, even though not permanent is a strong option.

We went past the Nothic and ran into Nihlus. He was pissed we messed up his plan to ambush Violence and attacked us.

Nihlus had some will o wisps with him. He summoned a big lightning dragon to attack us. Generally lightning themed abilities. "35 feet you fuckers". We wailed on him until he died.

Nihlus dropped his spellbook with some stuff in:

- illusory dragon
- chain lightning
- stormsphere
- stone skin
- call lightning
- lightning bolt
- misty step
- witchbolt
- shield
- mage armor

The corridor we fought him in was lined with steel carved with weapons and was surprisingly well maintained.

We opened a door and were immediately attacked by "Helmed Horrors" in the shape of Halaster. Guardian of Faith + Air Elemental Whirlwind created a kind of Horror pinball room.

The room the horrors were in is connected by a secret passage(?) to the library corridor.

We went to go have a rest in a hidden room we'd previously identified. On the way we found a room with a spectral hand holding a grey crystal ball. Theo picked up the orb and it introduced itself as a professor. Apparently he's always been an orb, and teaches regular classes but might not notice if no one turns up. His current class is "Grooming Habits of Shield Dwarves". Also teaches:

* History of the Undermountain
* Gemstone Identification
* Xorm (gem eating creatures)

We decided to steal the professor orb and take it with us, because of miscellaneous adventurer larceny reasons.

Finally we got to the long rest room, had a long rest, and levelled up!

We went through another matching secret door room from the library corridor. Found another room with prank statues in.
