# Session X+17

_Date: 08/12/23_

Attendance: Not Me

We organize that Ernest has the mimic and bag of holding.

We agree on the following marching order:
Theo - levitating
Zarrus  - Walking
Zere - Walking
Ernest - Horseback
Ivy - Air Elemental

We enter The Obstacle Course (AKA Trap world)

First room is full of pillars, whole floor is well lit.

A Magic mouth opens on a pillar and Hallister's voice says "Welcome to the Obstacle Course: please place all Magic items and weapons in the minecart and hurry!"

We try to talk to the voice but it is unresponsive.

Nobody leaves any items in the minecart.

We check the room for traps and find a pit trap with a glyph at the bottom. We jump the pit and procede.

Theo triggers a teleport trap. Rolls a 2 and disappears. A commentary voice shouts "TELEPORTED!". The rest of us hold hands and trigger the trap together. Just in time as a Stone Golem bears down on us.

Theo is teleported to a statue of Morodin (dwarf God) An inscription in dwarvish reads "All that is made can be unmade".

Exploring nearby reveals a rusted anvil, a shattered forge, a smashed door and the uncanny feeling of being watched.
Theo finds a cast iron ingot that could be used to forge a head that is half a dwarf and half a mindflayer skull.

The rest of the party are teleported to a statue of Tharmagool (Dwarf god of fire?), the statue tries to hit us with an axe. Ouch. 
An inscription underneath the statue reads "Fire is the cure".

We decide to hold a rope between us in case of surprising teleports.

We find a Mural of a dwarf in chains. Ivy fails a saving throw and the painting swaps Ivy with the dwarf. 

We chat to the dwarf, who is Called Thward Underbrew.

He came here as a champion of Gorm Golthin (dwarf god). Zarrus ascertains he has 9 levels in fighter and we add him to the party. Ernest is fascinated by his life story. The dwarf has been in the painting for hundreds of years, and his history is very old. Not from the same dwarfs as King Melair, also the dwarf confirms that the dwarvish we're reading is Duegar dwarvish, duegar are the race of dwarves driven mad by mindflayers attempting to make them a slave race.

We free ivy, by sending in Krenko.

We free krenko by burning the painting down.

We use the GONG orb to let Theo know where we are.

Theo finds a big pit with bloodstained walls, at the bottom is an alabastor sarcophagus with a blue rune and bat symbols. We can't tell if there's undead in it or not.

Upon the party being reunited the commentary comes back in.

We trigger a pit full of brown mould, and Zarrus falls in.
We decide for future pits we should use this rope we're all holding.
In the meantime we rescue Zarrus from the pit and prestidoigitate to prevent any mould getting on us.

We find a "door" that is an adamantine disk of concentric bones. It is very locked and secure. There is a keyhole in the centre.

Behind a different door we find Kavil. Kavil is a wizard student from the Wizard School, who as a form of detention was sent to this floor to biography the undead beholder. This task has driven him a bit mad. The room is full of ntoes that he obsessively scribbles.

The room also contains an archgate an inscription in dragonish reads "only a dragon can open this gate".

Kavil tells us he's not alone, indeed there are several invisible demons behind him. We cast faerie fire on the demons and a fight breaks out.

In the fight Kavil changes sides several times, ending on our side.
Fortunately without his spellbook he's kinda useless.

Sam gets Sythspiration for:
"How loudly can I roll my eyes"
