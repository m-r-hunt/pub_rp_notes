Upon arrival back in waterdeep the main party seek a backroom at "The Spectral Arms" to serve as a base of operations in the city and a safe place to leave Zarrus' body.

Zarrus meanwhile is on the astral plane where waterdeep is a swirling mass of incoherant thought and overwhelming noise. There is however an astral menace, a great mind "beneath" the city that seems to be bearing down upon waterdeep's citizens. Zarrus is accosted by a censor and an automatic voice telling him he needs a permit to stay on waterdeeps astral plane, Zarrus tries to press one to get through to an operator and is told all the lines are busy, but to procede to the "office" in the dockward.

Zarrus communicates all this through ezra to the party and the mindslayers set off to the dockward.
