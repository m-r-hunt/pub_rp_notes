Upon arrival back in waterdeep the main party seek a backroom at "The Spectral Arms" to serve as a base of operations in the city and a safe place to leave Zarrus' body.

Zarrus meanwhile is on the astral plane where waterdeep is a swirling mass of incoherant thought and overwhelming noise. There is however an astral menace, a great mind "beneath" the city that seems to be bearing down upon waterdeep's citizens. Zarrus is accosted by a censor and an automatic voice telling him he needs a permit to stay on waterdeeps astral plane, Zarrus tries to press one to get through to an operator and is told all the lines are busy, but to procede to the "office" in the dockward.

Zarrus communicates all this through ezra to the party and the mindslayers set off to the dockward.

The office turns out to be some guys run down house, upon knocking at the door an old man's voice objects screaming that his rent isn't due for many days. The party say they're here on astral business and the old man answers the door.

His name is Landulus Gruff, and he is very surprised to see the party. He is struck in shock and awe by the presence of the Gith sword, and the gith rezai himself stood there, it takes him some time to recover.

He is able to restore Zarrus to help, but wants to charge 20,000 gold the privalege, the party haggle him down to a bunch of their cool stuff instead. And decide to trust him.

Zarrus is restored. The party shares a heartfelt reunion with him.
Zarrus has come back with thickened blood, that congeals quickly, and also a newfound sensitivity to sunlight. Zarrus confesses to the party that his major fear was that by being trapped in the astral plane meant he would never get to go to hell and be reunited with his kin. Zarrus also admits the boars helmit, which was taken off him was cursed all along, and had been bestowing upon him an unnecessaryily large amount of hubris. Zere agrees to remove the curse now we know about it.

Landulus seems happy with his gifts, but the party want to know why he's here, and not in a real government office. We conclude his underfunding is the reuslt of midn flayer corruption attempting to leave the city psychicly defenceless. The party agree to sponsor his research, paying off his debts and allowing him to hire a research assistant.

Before we leave we see several independent scenes in and around waterdeep.

We see Theo check in with the harpers to relay information about the threats in the dungeon, he then perfects his armour into a set of mithril.

We see Ernest speak to his publishers to hand over the manuscript for "10 things you must know about the Shadowdusk family: number 3 will shock you", his biography of scryana shadowdusk RSVP.

We see Zarrus visit his family, and recount his adventures to his aging and forgetful mother. We also see him using his newfound astral ways to attempt to attune to the githyanki great sword, a very powerful magical weapon.

Ernest is keen to spread information about the mindslayers quest and their importance, thinking what an excellent biography the whole thing will make. He is approached by a halfling reporter, who asks him a number of questions including:
-Do you know of any mind flayers in the city?
-How can you kill an elder brain?
-Are you going back soon?
-What fighting technology are you bringing to bear?
At the last second the reporter gives away that he is a mindflayer spy, and disappears. Ernest decides it's best to tell nobody this happened.

Torbrinn returns. As we all remember Torbrinn is the slightly mad frog boy who decided we were gods after seeing us murder some evil snakes. He is covered in blood and ragged clothes. He says he has found a trinket for us and hands over a "circlet of blasting". He also says he killed a ""Assassin"" on the way here, and took a letter from him.

The assassin was attempting to deliver a missiv from our Death Slaad, it is written in formal, almost regal, lettering, but it's tone is far from pleasant. it says:
"COME TO THE SWAMP AT ONCE. MY ACTIVITIES HAVE CEASED. I WILL BARGAIN FOR MY FREEDOM. KNOW I AM YOURS AGAINST MY WILL."

We proceed into the dungeon with ezra as our guide through the "shadowpaths" a way down known to gith rezai. He says we'll need a boat, but instead Ivy turns into a "Lapras".

We sail through the first floor, and into the forest floor, we park the boat and go downstairs to some high ceilinged caves. Ezra takes us through tunnells we would not be able to find without him. We sneak past the spiders guarding the drow bit of muriels gauntlet, and follow the stairs down to the "Reeking caverns" we blag our way past some a drow guard post, and find the other side of the "den of filth" gateway which we know one half of is on the lost level.

We emerge into a cave made entirely of metal. Ezra reveals he knows we have to way down, but the way to the next floor is "the wake of a giant wurm"; so we may be here for some time.
