Recap.

# Ongoing Dwemer Core Exploration

Went around to the kitchen to find one of the few remaining unknown doors. Attempted to unionize the kitchen devils after telling them the dean was dead.

Found more kitchens and the larder.

Passed the gnothic and he was still weird.

Went into a weird room that appeared to be a villa courtyard. Skreana was there being lectured. Earnest told her the school is closing. Worked out the teacher was an illusion. Earnest tried to touch him and got ptsd.

Skreana didn't want to leave since she wants to become Hallaster's apprentice. Eventually we decided to kick off and kill Skreana.
The teacher just hung out while we had a fight, big chilling.
We defeated her and her shield guardians deactivated.

Found her family amulet on her. Famulet if you will. It was a shield guardian amulet linking her to the shield guardians and bound to her family by some blood inside it. Her spellbook:

* Detect magic
* Mage Armor
* Magic Missile
* Shield
* Misty Step
* Suggestion
* Counterspell
* Fireball
* Fly
* Greater Invisibility
* Ice Storm
* Cone of Cold

Had a short rest in this quite nice room, and chatted to the teacher. He's a shard of magic given purpose by Hallaster. Got good at illusion magic and now helps share that knowledge.

Opened another room and found Spite. Told him Dean was dead and he got weird with it. Really wants the fake!Dean's spellbook and will trade it for a magic tattoo. Really wants to get in with Halaster to become a cool magic boy. Definitely a nutter. Also there's a wizard tower on the moon.

We went outside to prepare a very subtle ambush. Theo became a large boy. We stabbed the momment and heard a cry of pain. Busted back in, Spite was gone and there was a dragon there. We attempted to not antagonise the dragon. The dragon attacked Spite's ogre friend. The ogre was really an Oni. We killed the oni quickly.

Chatted to the dragon afterwards. Ivy healed it and she was friendly to us. We sent her to the moon (and decided to check it ourselves next session).
