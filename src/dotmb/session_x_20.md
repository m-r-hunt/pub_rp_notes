# Session X+20

_Date: 12/01/24_

Attendance: Everyone

Fighting a big puzzle dragon. Thwad got mind controlled, or possibly just freed from mind control to be a bastard.

"Great weapon master? More like great weapon loser"

Killed the dragon in the end. Dropped cracked saphire and puzzle piece. Messed around with the gate and couldn't figure it out. Prof orb told us about the sapphire and it came from a dragon.

Interrogated Thwad about being the butcher. He was confused and sad. He came along with us to die in battle.

Faffed around with the gate some more, took bits out, nothing happened. Jethro yeeted a piece into the lava.

Wandered off down corridor. Opened a door and found a bunch of skeletons. I blew most of them up. There was a drow necromancer who was kind of unhelpful. "Lorlynn Zmirth". She also has a brother who makes skeleton. Left her without doing a murder.

Went down the corridor and went into another crypt (after a lot of faff). Some dead dwarfs. Also a dead mind flayer.

Continued. Caspar fell down a put, used feather fall but fell into a cloudkill. Got him out with a rope.

Found a suspicious alcove which was not trapped but we found a secret door instead. It a wheel labelled lever. Zarrus turned the wheel. Couldn't work out what was going on.

Went on, found a drow who died of beholdering. Had a spellbook, some dank mushes (healing potion mushes). I performed a funeral rite on him.

Found a room with a shitty dragon statue mounted on rollers. We took it with us to set off traps.

Various suspicious clicks happened but I did a bad job of noting down when.

Found an intimidating mist coming down a corridor. It followed us and then coalesced into a dude vampire.
