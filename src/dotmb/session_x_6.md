# Session X+6

_Date: 28/7/23_

Attendance: -Me

I wasn't here for this one.

Killed some mind flayers.

Found an abandoned armory.

Saw the cafeteria, also abandoned.

Can see a docking platform.

Found a loading dock. Some Gith hit the panic button. Did some crying in the walk-in.

Found a control panel. Pressed some buttons at random. Accidentally opened the airlock.

Opened a door and ran into some Gith. Zarrus went big and 1v1ed a dragon. Nothing else relevant happened. Except he did get killed in a oneshot.
