# Session X+21

_Date: 19/01/24_

Attendance: Everyone - Sophie 2nd half only

Fought the vampire and won but he misted out.

Went back to wheel room to rest in tiny hut. Matt was suspiciously interested in our resting arrangements.

Sam had a cool face tattoo. I remove cursed it.

Armitox gave me some more backstory. Trobriand is disgusted by the weakness of his flesh.

Caspar had a weird dream about being in the astral plane. Some kinda tentacle shit. (Elder brain making him depressed and less bonded to sword).

In the night someone invisible was bonking on the dome. There was an unseen servant there. Theo went and found and orthon (deez nuts). He was hanging out outside and firing crossbow bolts that curve wanted style. It's canon now it's in the notes. He's probably a bounty hunter.

Eventually decided to just sleep it off.
