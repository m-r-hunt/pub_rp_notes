# Session X+7

_Date: 4/8/23_

Attendance: Full House

Recap.

## RSVP Zarrus

Tried to diagnose Zarrus. He ded.

Faffed around with the control console. Repressurised the room and opened the southern blast doors.

Did a rest in a hut. Cast Raise Dead on Caspar. His body came back to life but he was unresponsive. Tried smashing the sword  that did him in. Ezira volunteered some info about the swords being valuable. Also he's a "zerth" spirit guide. Tried to get Zarrus's mind back.

Zarrus's mind was seperate from his body and he's stuck in the astral plain. Because he also died at the same time so his shit is fucked. Ezira's going to help him not get lost but can't heal him on the spot.

Ezira does have someone higher up the totem pole who may be able to help us.

## Having a Gas

Decided to try and get out. Went back to the central room. There was a big army of gith and dragons. Decided not to fuck around and/or find out, at least for now.

Went back to the dock room. Poked our noses out into space to see whether it's chill. It was relatively chill. Learned about gravity - mario galaxy rules.

Flew around through space as a gas to spy on the windows. Found some bedrooms. Found some children. Found maps. Found a launching platform. Found a giant diagram floating in space.

Explored some more rooms on the interior while in gas stealth mode. Found some dragonchess.

Went to the maps room. Found some cool maps of the asteroid and the crystal labyrinth.

Spent a long time debating what to do.
