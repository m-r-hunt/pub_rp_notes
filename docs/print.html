<p><em>By Chert Burtley of the Royal Danides Gazette</em></p>
<p>Early yesterday a dropship owned by the mercenary company &quot;The Mechanized Hussars&quot; was spotted landing at Danides Intersystem Spaceport in the planet's capital. This company was identified as those hired by King Edrasivir to &quot;stamp out the minor raids plagueing the system&quot; because although the Royal Guard would &quot;easily smash them&quot; they were &quot;too busy as court to be spared&quot;. When asked by a reporter from the disreputable rag &quot;The Davide Times&quot; about the claims made by the so-called &quot;Queen&quot;, the King simply spat and had the disrespectful reporter flogged. Quite right too, in this reporter's opinion.</p>
<p>The 3 mech company was met by stunning Princess Leona in her magnificent Blackjack. Princess Leona wore a particularly dashing royal guard uniform that really showed off her eyes, as I'm sure male readers will appreciate. They then paraded down the main city highway to reach the palace, performing an impromptu acrobatics display to the delight of the gathered crowd.</p>
<p>Pausing only to admire the mothballed giant mech in front of the palace, the company pilots entered for an audience with the king. Confidential sources inside the palace told this reporter that the King gave a rousing briefing, really inspiring the pilots as to the import of their task. Afterwards they were seen in contract negotiations with Vizier WIlikins, the king's right hand man.</p>
<p>They hardly had time to finish up before reports came in of a raid on a small mining installation near the capital. The bold mercenaries leapt into action, making great time back to their dropship and flying off to stop the raid.</p>
<p>A short but intense mech fracas followed, as the brave pilots gave the raiders whatfor in a show of boldness and derring-do. After disabling the raider's transport ship by the brilliant maneouver of standing on it, and destroying one of the enemy mechs, the fight was ended by the last enemy mech surrendering to the custody of our King's mighty forces.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for the next issue of the Royal Danides Gazette where we hope to bring you more updates on the fight against the Queen's raiders.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="royal-mercs-proving-ineffective"><a class="header" href="#royal-mercs-proving-ineffective">Royal Mercs Proving Ineffective</a></h2>
<p><em>By Bertrand Chertleson of the Danides Times</em></p>
<p>The mercenaries hired by the King to supplement the weak and ineffective royal guard, at great expense to the Danides taxpayer, have proven to be just as ineffective themselves. After the so-called &quot;victory&quot; against the Queen's raiders, the prisoner they captured has apparently disappeared from the public eye and not ended up in the royal dungeons facing due process and the rule of law. Instead rumors are flying that he has been recruited as a new senior member of the mercenary company.</p>
<p>Sources inside the palace suggest that the mercenaries finally signed an official contract with the monarchy, taking a gouging cut out of the royal treasury in the process. Meanwhile the DHS suffers from cut after cut and homelessness and unemployment continue to grow.</p>
<p>Even more shocking than that, the mercenaries have been spotted having a clandestine meeting over drinks (no doubt expensed to the Danides govenment) with Aloysius Cawl Jr, noted corrupt interstellar mining executive. Shipments of weapons in Interstellar Mining Co crates were later seen delivered to the Hussar's carrier. When approached for comment, IMC claimed that this was a &quot;misdelivery&quot; that would be resolved in due course. However, no attempt has so far been made to recover the goods.</p>
<p>Speculation as to the mercenaries next moves suggests they may deploy to defend the lunar research outpost unjustly imposed on Danides by the Lyran Commonwealth, more evidence that the weak monarchy must lick the boots of larger states to maintain a tenuous grip on sovereignty.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="breaking-news-update-popular-pilots-punch-pretenders-plunderers"><a class="header" href="#breaking-news-update-popular-pilots-punch-pretenders-plunderers">Breaking News Update: Popular Pilots Punch Pretender's Plunderers</a></h2>
<p><em>By Chert Burtley of the Royal Danides Gazette</em></p>
<p>The Airbourne Hussars struck another blow against the pretender queen's raiding forces once again today. Defending the Lunar Archeological Site against an attempt to sow havok and sour relations with the Lyran Commonwealth, they struck down a raiding force with prompt action.</p>
<p>Reports say that, after meeting with Professor Knut Ossler who heads the digging team, the Hussars executed a clever ruse involving hiding their mechs around the ruined city. When the raiders struck under cover of a lunar sandstorm, they struck out from their hiding places with a flawlessly executed attack.</p>
<p>During the fighting, one of the hussar's mechs was apparently struck down and rendered temporarily inoperable but should be recoverable.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for a final report on the conclusion of the battle and the fate of the enemy combatants and the hussar who was forced to eject. Stay tuned for more when it becomes available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="hussars-held-hostage"><a class="header" href="#hussars-held-hostage">Hussars Held Hostage</a></h2>
<p><em>By Bertrand Chertleson of the Danides Times</em></p>
<p>Events surrounding the conclusion of the battle over the Lunar Archaeological Site, which previously remained unclear, how now come to light. Thanks to a confidential source the Danides Times has exclusive information about the dramatic events that transpired.</p>
<p>As you may remember from our coverage, one member of the Galvanic Hussars was forced to eject before the end of the battle, a classic show of incompetence. This pilot, apparently known only as Donovan, found himself in an altercation with on of the pilots from the Queen's raiders, one Engeldeo de Roet, a down-on-his-luck nobleman from a minor Danidean house.</p>
<p>Apparently the confrontation ended non-violently, with this Donovan proceeding to attempting to smuggle de Roet on board the Hussars' dropship, after the conclusion of the battle and excavation of the disabled Hussar mech. His ruse was quickly uncovered, and there was a brief exchange of gunfire on board the ship. De Roet was seriously wounded, but due to first aid apparently provided by another member of the Hussars crew he was saved from death. This kind of absolute farce apparently is standard operating procedure for the Hussars.</p>
<p>After stabilizing him, the Hussars proceeded to interrogate de Roet before arranging for his transfer to custody of the Royal Danidean Guard who sent him directly to surgery for his gunshot wound. One source suggests that De Roet had even managed to smuggle an item of archeotech out of the Lunar Digsite which the Hussars confiscated, although the exact nature of this item is unknown. When approached for comment, they claimed De Roet was recovering and being held awaiting trial for high treason as well as interrogation for any information about the Queen's raiders he might have.</p>
<p>Finally, the Hussars proceeded for another session of backroom dealings with Vizier Wilikins behind closed doors. Rumor suggests they may be carrying out security inspections on local mining installations, no doubt with little benefit and great cost to the Danidean people.</p>

<p>Only much later was it discovered that HRs hard drive had been swapped for a fake. Indeed, it would have been missed completely had HR not requested IT recover some unbanked up files on his hard drive after it’s apparent “crash”. Given later events in the system, it’s reasonably safe to conclude it was stolen by the hussars and the information contained therein was passed to IPD.</p>
<p>Recommendation: tighten security protocols on Danides office. Suppress reports of incident and do not press charges to minimise further negative PR</p>

<p><em>Bertid Chertoux</em></p>
<p>Although largely overshadowed by the events that were to come, the Hussars raid on the rebel staging area in the Aquillae Valley, named after the Aquillae Dam which exposed it, proved to have a significant impact on the war as well as on the local topography.</p>
<p>Although difficult to verify, legend has it that the Hussars were collectively hung over from a particularly intense Tsartovian party they had engaged in onboard ship the night before. Boris Baklava in particular was said to have spent the previous 16 hours on the toilet recovering from the festivities, donned his mech suit and hopped into the cockpit with nary a shower.</p>
<p>Acting on intelligence that the base would be understrength due to a planned raid which would later prove to be out of date, the Hussars struck at the complex. Managing to reach the valley walls without being spotted, they had the drop on a defenceless skeleton crew. Although there was some initial resistance and defence turret fire, the Hussars detonated an explosive device on the midpoint of the dam, severely damaging it and causing an onrush of water. This mostly wiped out the opposing force.</p>
<p>The morality of this action has been debated by historians, philosophers, and hyrdological engineers to this day. Given the events that followed, the rapid conclusion of this skirmish proved to be a huge boon as the Hussars remained at almost full fighting strength. However, there was significant loss of life and disruption to the local biosphere.</p>

<p><em>Bertid Chertoux</em></p>
<p>Following the events of the battle of Aquillae Valley, the Hussars rushed back to the capital. They found the city in chaos, with the Queen's Raiders assualting the palace. This proved to be the climax of their campaign. The raiders had, with help from traitors inside the royal guard, infiltrated the palace complex and were in the process of comandeering the so-called &quot;Big Mech&quot;, the mothballed prototype that served as a symbol of Danidean Royal authority.</p>
<p>After they set down, the traitor within the Hussars revealed himself. Trent Malcolm sabotaged the Hussars dropship and left in his repaired scout mech. According to statements given later, the Hussars had not been aware of the extent to which the mech had been repaired and made operational by Malcolm, whilst he had been working aboard ship.</p>
<p>Queen Edrolla succesfully powered up the Big Mech using key information which Malcolm had stolen whilst aboard the Hussars dropship. Reunited with her spy, the Queen planned to escape aboard a modified cargo ship with her strike force. Unfortunately for her, the Hussars were still operating at strength and planned to stop her.</p>
<p>After an exchange of fire and a smokescreen had been deployed, the Queen was heading for her transport. In an unexpected move, Boris Baklava launched his mech &quot;Pingu&quot;, and managed an astonishing maneuver. He actually landed atop the Big Mech, exploiting the significant size disparity. Then, unbenownst to the Queen's forces, he abandoned his mech and landed atop the Big Mech on foot. The Queen's forces assumed their fire had succesfully crippled Pingu which fell to the ground unpiloted.</p>
<p>Boris Baklava then proceeded to infiltrate the Big Mech, catching the Queen unawares at the controls...</p>

<p><em>By Chert Burtley of the Royal Danides Gazette</em></p>
<p>A crushing blow has been dealt by the Ionic Hussars to the Queen's raiders. We have reports that the Queen herself was struck down by a brilliant tactical maneuver from one of the Hussars pilots. They really blew her away.</p>
<p>After cutting off the head of the snake, the Hussars swiftly dealt with any remaining resistance. The traitor Trent Malcolm was unfortunately killed in the chaos, missing out on a trial and a life in jail. On a similar unfortunate note, the captured criminal Engeldeo de Roet apparently also escaped from the palace detention area during the chaos, whereabouts currently unknown.</p>
<p>The Hussars received their well-deserved reward from the King, and apparently are awaiting the next intersystem transport before they head off into the galaxy for further adventures. The people of Danides wish them well.</p>

<h1 id="individual-questions"><a class="header" href="#individual-questions">Individual Questions</a></h1>
<h2 id="binding-of-immortal-souls"><a class="header" href="#binding-of-immortal-souls">Binding of Immortal Souls</a></h2>
<p>(See also research notes on roll20)</p>
<p>Naga souls always reform after n days. To kill permanently, bind soul to mortal coil. Cast ressurection-like spell, then defeat naga in combat. Turns them into bone naga. Kill bone naga, gone forever. We have knowledge to cast modified ressurection from this.</p>
<p>For Murial, nothing specific. Seems like Murial is reverse Naga. Body indestructible but soul could be weak. Unknown how to do this.</p>
<h2 id="sentient-staffs-and-such"><a class="header" href="#sentient-staffs-and-such">Sentient Staffs and Such</a></h2>
<p>If a powerful wizard keeps a staff, part of soul can become bound to staff. When they die, can live on in staff. But it sucks real bad. Worst way to be immortal.</p>
<p>Rantantar is/was chaotic illusionist. Weapon of choice was wand of wonder (powerful and chaotic, see handout on roll 20 for full detail). Rantantar turned against hallaster and worked with Jhesirya to modify nature of magic. Hallastar obliterated Rantantar but wand contains part of him. Rantantar is anti-hallaster, could be ally to us?</p>
<p>Armitox voluntarily became a staff. This is unusual. &quot;Avid researcher and complained about weakness of flesh&quot;. Had a lover (details missing) who bore staff.</p>
<h1 id="library-scene"><a class="header" href="#library-scene">Library Scene</a></h1>
<p>Zarrus got lost in library. Spots Darcy. Darcy returned him to the party. Zarrus got 20h madness, disadvantage on rolls more than 30 feet from Darcy.</p>
<h1 id="upgrading-armitox"><a class="header" href="#upgrading-armitox">Upgrading Armitox</a></h1>
<p>Turns out we had one of the 4 poisons the whole time from Murial. We argued a bit about whether this was a good idea and what the motivation is.</p>
<p>Armitox ate the poison, had a good time. Armitox is trying to destory an artifact that stole her boyfriend - Mighty Servant of Leuk-o</p>
<h1 id="resuming-exploration"><a class="header" href="#resuming-exploration">Resuming Exploration</a></h1>
<p>We decided to continue blimbling around the current floor. Killing the Naga to free their slaves, even though not permanent is a strong option.</p>
<p>We went past the Nothic and ran into Nihlus. He was pissed we messed up his plan to ambush Violence and attacked us.</p>
<p>Nihlus had some will o wisps with him. He summoned a big lightning dragon to attack us. Generally lightning themed abilities. &quot;35 feet you fuckers&quot;. We wailed on him until he died.</p>
<p>Nihlus dropped his spellbook with some stuff in:</p>
<ul>
<li>illusory dragon</li>
<li>chain lightning</li>
<li>stormsphere</li>
<li>stone skin</li>
<li>call lightning</li>
<li>lightning bolt</li>
<li>misty step</li>
<li>witchbolt</li>
<li>shield</li>
<li>mage armor</li>
</ul>
<p>The corridor we fought him in was lined with steel carved with weapons and was surprisingly well maintained.</p>
<p>We opened a door and were immediately attacked by &quot;Helmed Horrors&quot; in the shape of Halaster. Guardian of Faith + Air Elemental Whirlwind created a kind of Horror pinball room.</p>
<p>The room the horrors were in is connected by a secret passage(?) to the library corridor.</p>
<p>We went to go have a rest in a hidden room we'd previously identified. On the way we found a room with a spectral hand holding a grey crystal ball. Theo picked up the orb and it introduced itself as a professor. Apparently he's always been an orb, and teaches regular classes but might not notice if no one turns up. His current class is &quot;Grooming Habits of Shield Dwarves&quot;. Also teaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>History of the Undermountain</li>
<li>Gemstone Identification</li>
<li>Xorm (gem eating creatures)</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to steal the professor orb and take it with us, because of miscellaneous adventurer larceny reasons.</p>
<p>Finally we got to the long rest room, had a long rest, and levelled up!</p>
<p>We went through another matching secret door room from the library corridor. Found another room with prank statues in.</p>

<p><em>Date: 26/5/23</em></p>
<p>I didn't make notes for this one. Jethro was back and I hadn't commited to always making notes.</p>
<p>TL;DR We went into the death room and fought the dean who was a foxboy (arcanoloth). We killed him and stole his mysterious slaad gem. Also a book of runes which spawned our best friend, Krenko the goblin. Also his spellbook.</p>
<p>Went to headmaster's study, found a bunch of books about history. 20 books x 100gp = 2000gp</p>

<p><em>Date: 2/6/23</em></p>
<p>Recap.</p>
<h2 id="lore-dump"><a class="header" href="#lore-dump">Lore Dump</a></h2>
<p>Cast legend lore on the gem (i.e. not the slaad).</p>
<p>Gem of lord of foetid obliteration. Slaad used throughout DotMM as servants. Rumored MM can manufacture slaads, possibly using a &quot;spawning stone&quot; which attracs slaad and creates control gems. Death slaads most dangerous. Cunning tricksters, good at transforming and infiltrating, allow Halaster to control people.</p>
<p>This gem's slaad is lord of foetid obliteration. &quot;Most trusted but no slaad can be trusted&quot;. Gem controls mind and not heart of slaad. Lord is resentful of servitude. Most recently posting is figurehead of black tongue tribe, leading them into foetid stagnant fuedalism. (Black tongues are frog clan.)</p>
<p>We changed the slaad's orders to continue its previous instructions.
A lot of debate about what to do with the slaad.
We told it that it's not under hallaster's control and to get in touch via &quot;froggy messengers&quot; if necessary. And to tell us his previous instructions, hopes and dreams.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-dungeon-wandering"><a class="header" href="#back-to-dungeon-wandering">Back to Dungeon Wandering</a></h2>
<p>We found the shower.</p>
<p>We found a student's room. Found a non-poisoned banana which Zarrus ate. Turns out it was Skrianna's room. We decided to loot her chest. </p>
<ul>
<li>Broken Mirror</li>
<li>10x fine clothes</li>
<li>Wand</li>
<li>Poisoner's kit</li>
<li>Vial of Fine Perfume - 75gp</li>
<li>Diary - lover named Akkamar. References to family members Zalthar and Dezmyr, from shadowdusk hold, plan to return in force with construct halaster's building in Arcturiadoom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Went to another student room. Glyph of warding set off a thunder trap and fucked us up. It was Spite's room. Found a tiny jewelled chest. Of course we tried to open the chest. Gave off a conjuration magic signature. Theo checked for traps and it seemed fine. It was empty.</p>
<p>Found a vacant room. Definitely a normal empty room.</p>
<p>Went into another room. 16 cloudy jars containing preserved human brains. Find 9 other unbrained jars. Find a weird metal book with embossed pages. I drank the Potion of Comprehension to read it. Turns out it's a spell book written in Qualith (mindflayer-ese).</p>
<ul>
<li>Mind Blank</li>
<li>Dominate Monster</li>
<li>Globe of Invulnerability</li>
<li>Wall of Force</li>
<li>Modify Memory</li>
<li>Confusion</li>
<li>Lightning Bolt</li>
<li>Non-Detection</li>
<li>Invisibilty</li>
<li>Detect Thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>Went into another room. Found Elan, who's dead. Stabbed by his own sword. He had a portable lolth shrine. It makes people go mad but I resisted, it was fine. We burnt his body. A small spider scuttled away.</p>
<p>Opened the last room. There was an ogre zombie inside with a book inside its ribs. Killed the ogre very quickly. The book was another spellbook. Covers carved from coffinwood and pages made of stitched skin, written in blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animate Dead</li>
<li>Blight</li>
<li>Contact Other Plan</li>
</ul>
<p>We chucked it into our existing fire. It screamed on the way out. The wardrobe was full of red robes - it was Nihlus's room.</p>
<p>Found the coat room. Found the waiting room. Full of rubbish armchairs. Found the bathroom.</p>
<p>Went down to reading nook. Ran into Cephalosk (mind flayer lad). Told us the Elder Brain has put out a Ultharid to (eventually) found a splinter colony. Cephalosk hates this and wants us to kill him. Ultharid is obsessed with Waterdeep. Big mass of minds fascinates him. Is trying to create &quot;Alterdeep&quot; which is a &quot;simulation&quot; or &quot;grand illusion&quot; copy of the minds of Waterdeep. Just like Roblox. Elder Brain is focused on survival because of the precarious placement of the hive. Extremiton is the name of the Ultharid. He would give us more info if we give him Spite's brain.</p>
<p>Went into the &quot;portrait room&quot;. Has a big, possibly threatening, picture of the mad mage behind a curtain. We set fire to it.</p>
<p>Found a fountain room. Big mad mage fountain guarded by 2 Mezaloths. Not much going on.</p>
<p>Found another corridor with some bedrooms, connected to the one bedroom Air Elemental!Ivy had been to before.</p>
<p>Opened one of the doors and a wall of ice appeared. Ivy melted a hole and went in. Violence was there. We told her about the headmaster and she went off to find her sister and peace out. Her room has a little gloryhole over to Turbulence's neighbouring room.</p>
<p>Turbulence's room was boring, she's a fuckin nerdo.</p>
<p>Final student room: appeared to be looted. Had a signed Jim Darkmagic painting left over.</p>
<p>We found the garbage pit.</p>
<p>Found another painting room. 15 paintings behind a curtain. Each depicts a graduating class. Almost all show skeleton students. I spotted Castus who is skeletonised. Halaster is missing from the central portrait in the middle row. Theo tried to take that picture. He got an Elder Rune, the Rune of Halaster which exploded him a bit.</p>
<p>We found an alchemy room. Armitox told us the cauldron had living poison weirds in it so we didn't fuck with it. There were many alchemy ingredients and we stocked up on some misc things we needed.</p>
<p>We found a classroom. On one of the chalkboards. &quot;Wizards of Yore class canceled. Research Ahghairon circa 1071 DR. Expect a quiz!&quot; Ivy wrote &quot;The Dean is no more, Leave this floor&quot; instead.</p>
<p>Found a room with some braziers and spectators (i.e. shitty beholders). Apparently guarding some wizard supplies. Found a secret passage which lead to another room. Medley was there. We had a brief chat. She transformed into a Night Hag. A bunch of undead popped up and attacked us.</p>
<p>I turned undead and it actually worked. Caspar was enfeebled. Night Hag started to run away and put me to sleep. We killed her. The flesh golems wigged out. I got knocked out. We mopped up the flesh golems eventually.</p>
<p>We found a frog in a box in a barrel. It spat out a Gem of Seeing when we freed it.</p>
<p>We went to search Wormriddles room now she's dead. Found some Night Hag toenails, sweet loot. Some of her creepy dolls have moved around. They are voodoo dolls of all the students. We took the Spite andd Skriana ones and dispelled the rest.</p>

<p>Recap.</p>
<h1 id="ongoing-dwemer-core-exploration"><a class="header" href="#ongoing-dwemer-core-exploration">Ongoing Dwemer Core Exploration</a></h1>
<p>Went around to the kitchen to find one of the few remaining unknown doors. Attempted to unionize the kitchen devils after telling them the dean was dead.</p>
<p>Found more kitchens and the larder.</p>
<p>Passed the gnothic and he was still weird.</p>
<p>Went into a weird room that appeared to be a villa courtyard. Skreana was there being lectured. Earnest told her the school is closing. Worked out the teacher was an illusion. Earnest tried to touch him and got ptsd.</p>
<p>Skreana didn't want to leave since she wants to become Hallaster's apprentice. Eventually we decided to kick off and kill Skreana.
The teacher just hung out while we had a fight, big chilling.
We defeated her and her shield guardians deactivated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Break</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Found her family amulet on her. Famulet if you will. It was a shield guardian amulet linking her to the shield guardians and bound to her family by some blood inside it. Her spellbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect magic</li>
<li>Mage Armor</li>
<li>Magic Missile</li>
<li>Shield</li>
<li>Misty Step</li>
<li>Suggestion</li>
<li>Counterspell</li>
<li>Fireball</li>
<li>Fly</li>
<li>Greater Invisibility</li>
<li>Ice Storm</li>
<li>Cone of Cold</li>
</ul>
<p>Had a short rest in this quite nice room, and chatted to the teacher. He's a shard of magic given purpose by Hallaster. Got good at illusion magic and now helps share that knowledge.</p>
<p>Opened another room and found Spite. Told him Dean was dead and he got weird with it. Really wants the fake!Dean's spellbook and will trade it for a magic tattoo. Really wants to get in with Halaster to become a cool magic boy. Definitely a nutter. Also there's a wizard tower on the moon.</p>
<p>We went outside to prepare a very subtle ambush. Theo became a large boy. We stabbed the momment and heard a cry of pain. Busted back in, Spite was gone and there was a dragon there. We attempted to not antagonise the dragon. The dragon attacked Spite's ogre friend. The ogre was really an Oni. We killed the oni quickly.</p>
<p>Chatted to the dragon afterwards. It is named The Adored. Ivy healed it and she was friendly to us. We sent her to the moon (and decided to check it ourselves next session).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="session-x4"><a class="header" href="#session-x4">Session X+4</a></h1>
<p><em>Date: 7/7/23</em></p>
<p>Attendance: All</p>
<p>Recap.</p>
<h2 id="the-dangers-of-lichdom"><a class="header" href="#the-dangers-of-lichdom">The Dangers of Lichdom</a></h2>
<p>Opened the last door on the floor (maybe). It was labelled &quot;necromancy&quot;. Inside was Nestor, a servitor. We decided to listen to his lecture on the dangers of lichdom, for some reason.</p>
<p>You might become an allip if you get obsessed with knowledge. He showed us one.</p>
<p>If you fuck up the soul transfer potion, you might become a necreor (blood monster).</p>
<p>If you make a bad pact to gain power, you might become a wraith.</p>
<p>If you can't get the soul into the phylactery, your soul will wander off and bind itself to something else evil and become a boneclaw.</p>
<p>Nestor got so wrapped up in his studies he forgot to eat souls and became a demi-lich.</p>
<p>Advice on protecting phylacteries: make it unassuming or something adventurers want to keep.</p>
<p>We tried and failed to get the dragon to help us kill Nestor. After a bunch of faff, we decided to kick off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Break time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We fought and defeated Nestor and his undead buds.</p>
<p>Long Rest + Level Up</p>
<h2 id="to-the-moon"><a class="header" href="#to-the-moon">To The Moon</a></h2>
<p>Went to the moon with the dragon. Theo got a rune, which was good for once. It was all moonish.</p>
<p>The gate we came through crumbled. There were 3 other gates that we old and broken. There was a large runic circle. The runic circle had a slot to change the direction(?) currently set to up. There was an unmoving star above us.</p>
<p>The Adored did know Glister (now shadow dragon). Glister enjoyed being in human form and spent a long time accompanying an evil(?) human. Vanrak Moonstar of doom fame.</p>
<p>We took the portal up.</p>
<p>It was very hot where we ended up. Room filled with red scales. There was a gate here. Pedestal in front.</p>
<p>Tapestry to the north. Engraved floor.</p>
<p>Lava to the south. 6 speckled eggs sitting in the pool.</p>
<p>Massive dragon hoard to the west.</p>
<p>Went to check out the tapestries. They show Tiamat fighting stuff. Engraving of Tiamat on the floor. Seems to be a shrine. Also some doors, could hear children behind 1.</p>
<p>Opened a quiet door. There was a sleeping red dragon and some windows. We are in fact in space, and there's also a big red dragon chilling out in space. Decided to shut the door and try somewhere else.</p>
<p>Opened another door and found some Githyanki hanging out in a mess hall. They were eating some weird stuff.</p>
<p>Checked the treasure horde which was an illusion for some reason. Real pile of treasure to the north and passage to the south.</p>
<p>Went south and opened a door. There was another room. Altar and big statue of a githyanki warrior killing a mind flayer. And also a big ghost eye.</p>

<p>Decided to wait near the big eye inside a tiny hut. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Went to the next room, it seems to be a viewing gallery. Ivy noticed a secret trapdoor in the ceiling. Popped open the door and encountered some Githyanki. We surrendered to them - Earnest got tied up and we had a bit of a standoff. The Githyanki knight went to get help. Came back with someone who could communicate.</p>
<p>Eventually they tried to levitate us upwards so we kicked off.</p>
<p>We had a big fight involving some badly done multilevel rooms.</p>
<p>Looted the bodies, one of the gith had a bunch of gems in their armour. The knight had a cool silver greatsword. One of the Gish had a rod of some kind.</p>
<p>Took a short rest in a tiny hut. Ivy got some heat exhaustion. Earnest discovered that the rod was sweet smoky and spicy.</p>
<p>Opened some doors that seem to be prison cells. Found a Githzerai. Asked him WTF is going on. Ezira.</p>
<p>The Crystal Labyrinth is a Githyanki outpost in DotMM. Linked to here. Red dragons and Githyanki are allies, Githyanki knights use young red dragons as mounts.</p>

<p>Found a control panel. Pressed some buttons at random. Accidentally opened the airlock.</p>
<p>Opened a door and ran into some Gith. Zarrus went big and 1v1ed a dragon. Nothing else relevant happened. Except he did get killed in a oneshot.</p>

<p>Tried to diagnose Zarrus. He ded.</p>
<p>Faffed around with the control console. Repressurised the room and opened the southern blast doors.</p>
<p>Did a rest in a hut. Cast Raise Dead on Caspar. His body came back to life but he was unresponsive. Tried smashing the sword  that did him in. Ezira volunteered some info about the swords being valuable. Also he's a &quot;zerth&quot; spirit guide. Tried to get Zarrus's mind back.</p>
<p>Zarrus's mind was seperate from his body and he's stuck in the astral plain. Because he also died at the same time so his shit is fucked. Ezira's going to help him not get lost but can't heal him on the spot.</p>
<p>Ezira does have someone higher up the totem pole who may be able to help us.</p>
<h2 id="having-a-gas"><a class="header" href="#having-a-gas">Having a Gas</a></h2>
<p>Decided to try and get out. Went back to the central room. There was a big army of gith and dragons. Decided not to fuck around and/or find out, at least for now.</p>
<p>Went back to the dock room. Poked our noses out into space to see whether it's chill. It was relatively chill. Learned about gravity - mario galaxy rules.</p>
<p>Flew around through space as a gas to spy on the windows. Found some bedrooms. Found some children. Found maps. Found a launching platform. Found a giant diagram floating in space.</p>
<p>Explored some more rooms on the interior while in gas stealth mode. Found some dragonchess.</p>
<p>Went to the maps room. Found some cool maps of the asteroid and the crystal labyrinth.</p>

<h2 id="team-trees"><a class="header" href="#team-trees">Team Trees</a></h2>
<p>Decided to work on executing our tree based teleportation plan. Need to go back to the fridge. Open the door to the map room and got into a fight with some Gith guards. Killed them.</p>
<p>Found some info about the Gith swords. They are specifically designed to sever mind and body. On crit, forces astral projection. Normally reversible but dying at the same time messes you up (e.g. Zarrus). Suggests repair using the spell Tether Essence.</p>
<p>One of the gish was reading about scrying magic/divination. Also took a crystal ball which was not nailed down. It's the magic item &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;.</p>
<p>Went back to the airlock room to chill out. Ivy looked at the food in the fridge to find out what to use as a plant teleporter.</p>
<p>While chilling, some red mist entered the room. We dispelled it, and it turned into a dwarf. Ashtyrranthor. We remembered this is actually the adult red dragon who's been around the asteroid. We explained the situation. (Gith commander Commander Zolcharrx, 2nd in command Raajna). He is relatively fine with us as long as we don't hurt red dragon children.</p>
<p>The red dragons were here first on the asteroid. Githyanki came later. They made friends.</p>
<p>Ashtyrranthor told us about a quest to steal a magic item from the Gith commander. A manual of golems. Basically it would be funny to steal it.</p>
<p>The Gith are pissed at us, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Ashtyrranthor left us in peace.</p>
<p>We rested and executed our long rest and plant teleport plan. It worked well. We ended up back in waterdeep.</p>
<p>Made some plans for what to do in waterdeep before venturing back into the dungeon.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="session-x9"><a class="header" href="#session-x9">Session X+9</a></h1>
<p><em>Date: 27/8/23</em></p>
<p>Attendance: Not me</p>
<p>Notes courtesy of Jethro</p>
<p>Upon arrival back in waterdeep the main party seek a backroom at &quot;The Spectral Arms&quot; to serve as a base of operations in the city and a safe place to leave Zarrus' body.</p>
<p>Zarrus meanwhile is on the astral plane where waterdeep is a swirling mass of incoherant thought and overwhelming noise. There is however an astral menace, a great mind &quot;beneath&quot; the city that seems to be bearing down upon waterdeep's citizens. Zarrus is accosted by a censor and an automatic voice telling him he needs a permit to stay on waterdeeps astral plane, Zarrus tries to press one to get through to an operator and is told all the lines are busy, but to procede to the &quot;office&quot; in the dockward.</p>
<p>Zarrus communicates all this through ezra to the party and the mindslayers set off to the dockward.</p>
<p>The office turns out to be some guys run down house, upon knocking at the door an old man's voice objects screaming that his rent isn't due for many days. The party say they're here on astral business and the old man answers the door.</p>
<p>His name is Landulus Gruff, and he is very surprised to see the party. He is struck in shock and awe by the presence of the Gith sword, and the gith rezai himself stood there, it takes him some time to recover.</p>
<p>He is able to restore Zarrus to help, but wants to charge 20,000 gold the privalege, the party haggle him down to a bunch of their cool stuff instead. And decide to trust him.</p>
<p>Zarrus is restored. The party shares a heartfelt reunion with him.
Zarrus has come back with thickened blood, that congeals quickly, and also a newfound sensitivity to sunlight. Zarrus confesses to the party that his major fear was that by being trapped in the astral plane meant he would never get to go to hell and be reunited with his kin. Zarrus also admits the boars helmit, which was taken off him was cursed all along, and had been bestowing upon him an unnecessaryily large amount of hubris. Zere agrees to remove the curse now we know about it.</p>
<p>Landulus seems happy with his gifts, but the party want to know why he's here, and not in a real government office. We conclude his underfunding is the reuslt of midn flayer corruption attempting to leave the city psychicly defenceless. The party agree to sponsor his research, paying off his debts and allowing him to hire a research assistant.</p>
<p>Before we leave we see several independent scenes in and around waterdeep.</p>
<p>We see Theo check in with the harpers to relay information about the threats in the dungeon, he then perfects his armour into a set of mithril.</p>
<p>We see Ernest speak to his publishers to hand over the manuscript for &quot;10 things you must know about the Shadowdusk family: number 3 will shock you&quot;, his biography of scryana shadowdusk RSVP.</p>
<p>We see Zarrus visit his family, and recount his adventures to his aging and forgetful mother. We also see him using his newfound astral ways to attempt to attune to the githyanki great sword, a very powerful magical weapon.</p>
<p>Ernest is keen to spread information about the mindslayers quest and their importance, thinking what an excellent biography the whole thing will make. He is approached by a halfling reporter, who asks him a number of questions including:
-Do you know of any mind flayers in the city?
-How can you kill an elder brain?
-Are you going back soon?
-What fighting technology are you bringing to bear?
At the last second the reporter gives away that he is a mindflayer spy, and disappears. Ernest decides it's best to tell nobody this happened.</p>
<p>Torbrinn returns. As we all remember Torbrinn is the slightly mad frog boy who decided we were gods after seeing us murder some evil snakes. He is covered in blood and ragged clothes. He says he has found a trinket for us and hands over a &quot;circlet of blasting&quot;. He also says he killed a &quot;&quot;Assassin&quot;&quot; on the way here, and took a letter from him.</p>
<p>The assassin was attempting to deliver a missiv from our Death Slaad, it is written in formal, almost regal, lettering, but it's tone is far from pleasant. it says:
&quot;COME TO THE SWAMP AT ONCE. MY ACTIVITIES HAVE CEASED. I WILL BARGAIN FOR MY FREEDOM. KNOW I AM YOURS AGAINST MY WILL.&quot;</p>
<p>We proceed into the dungeon with ezra as our guide through the &quot;shadowpaths&quot; a way down known to gith rezai. He says we'll need a boat, but instead Ivy turns into a &quot;Lapras&quot;.</p>
<p>We sail through the first floor, and into the forest floor, we park the boat and go downstairs to some high ceilinged caves. Ezra takes us through tunnells we would not be able to find without him. We sneak past the spiders guarding the drow bit of muriels gauntlet, and follow the stairs down to the &quot;Reeking caverns&quot; we blag our way past some a drow guard post, and find the other side of the &quot;den of filth&quot; gateway which we know one half of is on the lost level.</p>
<p>We emerge into a cave made entirely of metal. Ezra reveals he knows we have to way down, but the way to the next floor is &quot;the wake of a giant wurm&quot;; so we may be here for some time.</p>

<p>Recap.</p>
<p>Encountered a worm trench. Dug by a mechanical giant worm named Dug. Armitox is interested in the poison.</p>
<p>Met some hobgoblins. They are looking out for a gnome named Zux, torbrann's apprentice, something about metal scorpions. Their boss is a hobgoblin warlord named Doom Crown. Doom Crown serves the fire giants.</p>
<p>This is Trobrann's Graveyard. The floor above is Arcturiadun.</p>
<p>Worm came past, some of us fell over.</p>
<p>Ended up deciding to help the hobgoblins against Zux. Went north to a big battlefield around an arch. Metal scorpions/Scaladar were around as well as arbalests (flying crossbows).</p>
<p>Helped some hobgoblins snipe at the monsters around the big arch. We beat them all up although all the hobgobs died, including Kellog. Some of us coincidentally found some shiny new +1 half plate.</p>
<p>Zarrus attempted to kill the arch with his warpick but did not have much success.</p>

<h2 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h2>
<p>Each player will roll 10 dice by default, at the start of each fight you can choose one of the following levels of risk and gain bonus dice accordingly. Not all levels will be available for all fights, GM to clarify minimum and maximum acceptable risk. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risk of failure - +2 dice
Failure comes in many forms. Being forced to flee, being captured, getting stuck with the bill, or worst of all, having to admit that you were in the wrong when it was totally the other persons fault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk of Injury - +4 dice
Injuries are lasting impacts on your character. They may be physical wounds that need time to recover and leave lasting scars. They may become negative traits to your personality, or damage to your reputation or relationships with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk of Death - +6 dice.
Make no mistake character death is now on the line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your dice pool is assembled then we play Rivers and Lakes combat rules.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-combat"><a class="header" href="#out-of-combat">Out of Combat</a></h2>
<p>There may be times when an action is uncertain outside of a combat encounter. When this occurs the default resolution mechanic will be:
The GM will set a difficulty for the task. </p>
<ul>
<li>3 – Easy</li>
<li>4 – Normal </li>
<li>5 – Hard</li>
<li>6 – Impossible</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll 2D6 and count the number of dice that equal to or exceed the target value. 
If there are 0 successes, then the task is an unmitigated failure. Whatever the situation is, it is about to get a whole lot worse. The GM will narrate the escalation.
If there is 1 success then the task is a partial success. It might not achieve everything you wanted to achieve, or it might have a cost beyond the straightforward cost. The GM will narrate the outcome and may add details to clarify the partial nature of your success.</p>
<p>If there are 2 or more successes then you have fully succeeded and get to narrate the outcome.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-dice"><a class="header" href="#bonus-dice">Bonus Dice</a></h3>
<p>There are several ways that you might gain bonus dice for a roll. If you do then simply add any and all applicable bonus dice to your initial two dice that you roll. You still count all success rolls and are after as many successes as possible.</p>
<h2 id="qi-points"><a class="header" href="#qi-points">Qi Points</a></h2>
<p>At the start of each session all characters will receive one Qi point. These points will last until used and may be spent to do any of the following at any time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gain a bonus dice for an out of combat roll.</li>
<li>Adjust any single dice (in or out of combat) after rolling, by a single pip. (4-&gt;5 or 4-&gt;3)</li>
<li>Reroll up to 3 dice from your combat pool at any point during the combat.</li>

<p>We discussed the layout and composition of the Kung Fu Court dojo.

<p>Another recap, this time Captain Burton's diary.</p>
<h2 id="a-flawless-break-in"><a class="header" href="#a-flawless-break-in">A Flawless Break-In</a></h2>
<p>We found ourselves in a cave. Did some shenanigans to create light.</p>
<p>Followed UB40 to a big door, engraved with a (dragon) face-like symbol. It had a keypad lock. Tried a random number, didn't work, an AI came to sass us. Eventually Saint hotwired the door open.</p>
<p>Went in and found a bar/lounge staffroom. Empty of people.</p>
<p>I followed UB40 into a workshop where he went to charge. Got maced by a folder marked &quot;secret plans&quot;. Duct taped a gun to my back for future usage.</p>
<p>There was totally normal wifi available with password on a corkboard. Wandered through some bunk rooms, not much in there.</p>
<p>Found a projector room. Turned it on, a Jackie Chan movie was playing. Turned on some computers, one was the AI system. He was unhelpful. We renamed him to Kold Feelingless Computer.</p>
<p>Eventually we discovered the plot inside a whiskey bottle. Two papers: one had a list of elements</p>
<ul>
<li>Water - Ancient Juncture - Golden Temple of the Lotus - <code>&lt;coordinates&gt;</code></li>
<li>Air - Contemporary Juncture - London Observatory - <code>&lt;coordinates&gt;</code></li>
<li>Fire - Future Juncture - Mt. Etna - <code>&lt;coordinates&gt;</code></li>
<li>Earth - Past Juncture - Kowloon Docks -  - <code>&lt;coordinates&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Other paper had some kind of magic circle-ish diagram with &quot;vessel cube goes here&quot; in the middle.</p>
<p>UB40 confused us after we asked him to take us to the ancient juncture. Eventually we plugged him into the PC and he was able to answer more directly.</p>
<p>Told us that the vessel cube holds elements. Needed clarification on which entrance in junctures to go to.</p>
<h2 id="going-potty"><a class="header" href="#going-potty">Going Potty</a></h2>
<p>We followed him out to the ancient juncture. On the way we encountered 2 terracotta warriors.</p>
<h3 id="fight-highlights-3"><a class="header" href="#fight-highlights-3">Fight Highlights</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ineffective nut cracker</li>
<li>Broke the ear off one and chucked at the other</li>
<li>Harlem blocked a big sword hit with his hand, flipped it over with judo throws</li>
<li>1-inch punched it in the chest</li>
<li>Saint saved the rest of us with strength and a bulletproof umbrella</li>
<li>Umbrella up the jacksie and then shattered from the inside</li>
<li>Sonic cufflink toll the dead attack</li>
</ul>
<p>That was the end basically. Saint cleaned up and Isamu pocketed some dust.</p>

<p>Recap was apparently omniscient interdimensional news.</p>
<h2 id="fishing-for-trouble"><a class="header" href="#fishing-for-trouble">Fishing for Trouble</a></h2>
<p>We found ourselves in a smoking/drying hut full of fish. Fucked around a bit, could hear people outside.</p>
<p>Went outside, it was a fishing village. They immediately kicked off. We considered surrendering when Saint was negotiating but then just went to fight.</p>
<h3 id="fight-highlights-4"><a class="header" href="#fight-highlights-4">Fight Highlights</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bad priest guy tried to breathe poison but Harlem interrupted him</li>
<li>Isamu fought using a coracle/small boat to counter fisherwoman's boat hook</li>
<li>Saint needlessly spilled their cooking pot</li>
<li>Saint burned the fisherwoman in a possibly racist way. &quot;I continue talking&quot;</li>
<li>Then handcuffed her to a tree</li>
<li>Harlem's 1-inch punch was blocked</li>
<li>The boat get set on fire and then used to finish off the priest</li>
<li>Saint got squid attacked and ninja starfished until taking an injury - now facially scarred</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meandering-up-river"><a class="header" href="#meandering-up-river">Meandering Up River</a></h2>
<p>I searched the priest - stole his dagger and lotus pills (possibly for poison breath).</p>
<p>We interrogated some villagers. Found out the temple is about 4 miles upstream.</p>
<p>Hired a kid to take us upriver, along with a man in a boat. (Also it turns out going through the netherworld gave us babel fish powers)</p>
<p>Arrived at the temple. We spent too long on a needlessly convoluted plan to distract temple guards using the kid as bait. Fisherman got killed in a totally preventable way.</p>
<p>Cut right before the fight kicked off.</p>

<p>Recap was a monologue by the kid.</p>
<h2 id="infiltration"><a class="header" href="#infiltration">Infiltration</a></h2>
<p>Stealth takedowns on the 2 guards. Harlem was a distraction. Isamu dropped a fruit on one's head, Saint chloroformed the other.</p>
<p>Grappling hooks up the pagoda. Top floor empty, no element here.</p>
<p>Went down a floor - fancy bedroom. Stole some love letters.</p>
<p>Went down again - big magic pool. Put cube in it, a tidal wave appeared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Break time</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reflection"><a class="header" href="#reflection">Reflection</a></h2>
<p>Confronted by water shadow versions of ourselves in a void.</p>
<p>Isamu flipped for it. Saint had tea and then left politely. Harlem got some cryptic information.</p>
<p>On reentering the real world, there were sounds of pursuit up the tower. Harlem went up to escape and find the kid while Saint and Isamu stayed to fight.</p>
<h2 id="fight-highlights-5"><a class="header" href="#fight-highlights-5">Fight Highlights</a></h2>
<p>Saint kicked some guards down the stairs and attached a grenade, killing many mooks.</p>
<p>Isamu applied the Kentucky French Caress to some guards coming up the outside.</p>
<p>Harlem fought a priest in the basement with a dagger. Some cool shit with fire and light happened. Priest had weird water powers but Harlem ended up stabbing his heart.</p>
<p>Hopping vampire appeared in the pool room. Piledrivered Saint into the basement.</p>
<p>Isamu followed, stuck him with the cube which messed with him, then deployed the back up gun.</p>
<p>After the fight we burned down the temple, starting the fire with the love letters. (And looted the bodies but not too much there).</p>

<p>We think we're in the past. We set up a silly plan with nested letters to try and figure this out for sure.</p>
<p>We followed UB40 back to the dragon hideout. Faffed around a bit - Saint failed to repair his suit and Isamu grabbed a beer.</p>
<p>Then we went back to the Past Juncture for the first time.</p>
<h2 id="past-juncture"><a class="header" href="#past-juncture">Past Juncture</a></h2>

<li>Sandy Harlers</li>
</ul>
<p>Spoke to a guy Ping Chu. The fight accidentally helped him with the monk. &quot;Go and ask for Mei Ming&quot;. Also recommended some tailors.</p>
<p>Also got some money. It appears to be the 1840s-50s. Went to the tailor and got clothes.</p>
<p>Went to the embassy and knocked on the front door to find out about the letter. Bullshitted our way into meeting &quot;The General&quot;. Seem to have landed in it.</p>
